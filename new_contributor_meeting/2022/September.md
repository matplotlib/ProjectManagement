### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting, like all project spaces is meant to be open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and it's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all matplotlib spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

## Agenda

**Present:** Noa Tamir (@noatamir), Greg Lucas (@greglucas)
> please add your names (and github handle in brackets). This will makes it easier to stay in touch later in Gitter and on issues and pull requests (PRs) üòâ
> This is optional since these notes will be recorded in our Github repository. If you'd like you can also paste your answer in the zoom chat üòâ

*Feel free to add items for discussion to this agenda!*

* Introductions: 
	* Name 
	* A bit about our experience with matplotlib/python as users
	* Newcomer: why are we interested to start working with the project
	* Maintainer/contributor: how long have we worked with the project and what do we primarily do
* [name=Noa Tamir] Contributor Experience Lead, she/◊î◊ô◊ê/sie
	* I joined Matplotlib in March so I'm relatively new as well. At the moment I am mostly working on documenation, and contributor exprience related issues (for example organizing this meeting).
* [name=Greg Lucas] Matplotlib Maintainer he/him
	* I joined Matplotlib about a year ago, but have been using it for quite some time now. I come from an Earth modeling and satellite data analysis background. In that regard, I am also a maintainer of another Python package, Cartopy, for plotting the data I work with on maps within Matplotlib.
> Newcomers please add items to the agenda based on your interests! What would you like us to discuss? do you want to ask something? are you already working on a specific PR? you can add a link to it ‚ú® Would you like to get some guidance on how to navigate some of the code?

### Communication channels

How will we communicate asynchronously while working on the project?
* [Gitter](https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib)
	* A chat platform which is useful for shorter questions
	* #incubator channel, our non-public communication channel for new contributors

* [Discourse](https://discourse.matplotlib.org/)
	* A forum platform which is useful for longer questions that are harder to ask on chat 
* [Developer mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-devel)
	* We publish information which is important for contributors on this list. People from other projects might also share useful information or questions here. That said, it is also mirrored on our discourse üòâ (unless we there's a technical issue like happened recently üôÑ)
