# 3 Dec 2018
## Agenda
[ ] Testing: drop 3.5?  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12538
  [ ] Do we need Azure and all the Travis runs?  
[ ] Performance profiling: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12915  Can we have a proper profiling test?  Seems maybe some import profiling is happening that tests pathological import cases.  
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10841 ping @efiring (New date formatter)
  [ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12909 Format all ticks at once.  (Should go in before above?)
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12903  Units math…


## Notes

**testing drop 3.5?**

- numpy 1.11 minimum
- still need mac and pc on Azure before switching

**profiling - optimizing imports and the like** 

- low hanging fruit
- straight python work - maybe good first issue? 

**12909: formatters formatting all ticks at once**

- creates method for running list comprehension over list of ticks

**isinstance in formatters?** 

- checking for membership in class and not documenting @Eric F 
- API change w/ no note change 

**12903: time has datetime + time delta**

- categories has literals and float delta (for spacing ‘cause of cat→int mapping)
- tries to directly do math on values (like a time delta) because axis supports it
  - default to overloaded class methods (like +, -)
- falls back on calling convert on values if [+- not overloaded](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/not-overloaded-GwKLO91ub6MVrkm1BVKru) 

**WIP fall off dates,  policy on closing old PRs**

- needs revision/needs adoption 
- label clean ups

**documentation sprint**

- sort out what to write for grant to hire full time technical writer for a year 
- write a 2 page Work Plan for sprint -@hannah by end of January 
  - what we want to get out of it
    - better scoping of matplotlib
    - example: concrete data driven examples vs. random numbers
  - who wants to come/interested in coming 
- numpy small grants- apply 
- Boulder as location  @Ryan M 
- work around academic schedules 
- Overhaul and revise documentation
- need to include information about visualization basics (not mpl specific)
- more toy-datasets rather than random data

**TODO: ALL THE GOVERNANCE THINGS -** @Thomas C ****@Eric F ****@Ryan M ****


# 19 Nov 2018

# #12 Nov 2018
## Agenda
[ ] Admin backlog 
  [ ] Governance
  [ ] Swag logo (numfocus email)
    What version of the Matplotlib logo would you want featured on the shop? I was thinking it might be nice to use one that actually says "Matplotlib," but the only file I have like that is very long and narrow and the font is sort of odd.
    Do you want us to come up with something on your behalf? Is just the circle logo okay?
  [ ] Community outreach

# 05 Nov 2018
## Agenda
[x] Other 3.0.x https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/milestone/39
[ ] Github policies and best practices:
  [ ] cleaning up old issues w/ no feedback 
  [ ] user help versus actual issue…
[ ] Doc builds
## Notes

**Azure:**

- need to find way of copying permissions over: no group privileges…
- may take over some of the testing from Travis.

**github policy** 

- bot - we think this has gone silent, after n weeks bot will close, reopen on interest
- at least one round of conversation
  - invite them to close themselves, “think this is not a bug because X” 
    - use “needs confirmation” tag
    - support: stack overflow, mailing list, gitter
- bug reports are self selecting/small chunk of things people fine
  - can assign teasing out the question issues to @hannah a 

**docs deploy cycle**

- auto building of docs not set up
- circle CI config 
- or @Elch R can do it manually more often
- docs organization:
  - matplotlib.org/rendered docs: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.github.com
  - pipeline: 
    - website gets published to top level
    - matplotlib.org/version gets to version docs
    - matplotlib.org/project yields project docs - manually c&p’ed by maintainers
- possibly use submodules to refactor: https://help.github.com/articles/using-submodules-with-pages/
  - top level is current
  - submodules for old versions
  - submodules for externel projects (their existing repos)
  - can use git-filter tree to maintain history

## Agenda:


[ ] Py3.5 in 3.1? 
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11711 lazy eval colors
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/milestones/v3.0.x
[ ] API changes level of detail.  Mechanism for enforcing…  i.e. numpy is more concise (?)
## Notes
- went through some v3.0.x PRs.  Nov 3 weekend first w/e @tacaswell can get to it
- Py 3.5
  - schedule is for dropping for 3.1
  - need a good reason for dropping;
  - Bug fix policy….
    - don’t have people to maintain too many bug fix branches
    - can backport critical bugs
  - Features in python that are worth doing
    - kw-only arguments 
    - kw-argument order: API can be cleaned up (i.e. color, facecolor, do in order they came in).  
  - Default packages don’t include new versions of matplotlib…
  - Solutions for upgrading python are much better than before…
  - communication downstream:
    - user and devel list (@tacaswell) 
- 
# 1 Oct 2018
## Agenda
[ ] Stale PR mechanism?  https://github.com/apps/stale, astropy has hand-built version.  Let more people tag?  More people close issues?  https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/11326
[ ] More get_tightbbox including artists that are not meant to be included.  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12256
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9565: How to deprecate the return value from `stem` method?  
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12312


## Notes


- still need to resolve how to move #9565 forward….
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12312
  - arbitrary scale needed?  
  - colorbars need some clean up still
- powernorm issue
- For annotate and ax.legend consider adding `in_layout=` kwarg…. TODO: @jklymak 
- PR Stale:
  - concerns about politeness
  - maybe adds noise 
  - need to encourage a culture of closing issues. 
  - Didn’t talk about letting more people close issues.
# 24 Sep 2018
## Agenda
[ ] 3.0.x bugs: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/milestone/37



## Notes:
- because of https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12213 we should release 3.0.1 pretty soon.  And https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12177
  -  [#12173](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12173) might not just be windows.  
  - @efiring indicated that maybe on MacOSX as well
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/9485 perhaps also relevant.
- Sphinx issue
  - search
  - math directive - > mathmpl

# 17 Sep 2018
## Agenda
[ ] tick locators.  Why return bracketing values?   Why worry about pixel size? https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12105 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11004
[ ] Date Formatter: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10841  Path to acceptance?  Pros better. Cons, API change


## Notes
- tick locators:
  - old was based on ticks rather than margins
  - half pixel to reduce fiddling
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1310
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/1686
  - seem to have conflicting requirements
    - on one hand we want to make the locators more separable from axis
    - on the other hand we want may need to have access to the scales to work in pixel space so we need
  - @Jody K ‘s PR moves the ‘pixel’ level clipping to the Axis object rather than the the locator
  - Maybe keep extra ticks but trim in `axis.py`
  - Ticks kept and removed…  ticks not drawn versus not created confusing
  - TODO: look at log locators; check axis API.  Check drawing / having extra ticks…
- Date locator:
  - TODO: localization
  - 
- Proposal: 
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10928
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10411/files should maybe be merged / done as part of / after proprocess data (not before).
  - @Thomas C is on board with this.
# 10 Sep 2018
## Agenda
[ ] Backend continues:  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11962
[ ] jquery: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11246  
  [ ] needs caching in place?
[x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12012 Fallback renderer for text (just like we did for legend)
[x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11966  Cartopy was using private method.  Fix already in master for cartopy.  
[ ] color sequence management and colormaps:
  - see https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12009 New Tableau colormaps.
  - what is level for adding new colormap
  - how do we go from colormap to color cycles?
  - better advertisement  of packages that provide more colormaps or add such a repository to the matplotlib tree?  i.e `cmocean`
[x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12037 artist.get_aliases  API change…
[ ] PR https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11936 sphinx-exhibit
[x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/10948 OS/X backend deprecation warning  for event_notify:
  [x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12053  merged


## Notes


- backend issue: needs another review
- jquery
  - not actually all that urgent. 
  - might be moot when `ipympl` gets going and replaced `nbagg`…
  - still relevant for webagg
- Renderer issues for get_window_extent
  - mixed-mode renderer needs to specify renderer
  - just always fallback to figure renderer?  
  - too much implicitness…
  - but artists can’t move between figures.  So each artist has a figure…
  - force draw after saving…
  - all caches onto figure and off individual figures…  
  - renderer=None → cahced renderer
  - instantiate a renderer at figure creation?
    - svg, pdf, only created when saving figure…
      - they use agg etc 
      - but if initialized w/ pdf tight_layout etc don’t work??
    - get_window_extent screen space…
- Cartopy GeoAxes
  - lost `._subplot_classes`  but Cartopy pre-master still uses it.  
  - @Antony L and @Thomas C looking at it.
- Colormaps, color cycles, palettes, style sheets 
  - merging colormaps and palettes?  Keep separate? 
    - palette: discrete set of colors
      - discrete lines and areas
      - flag is really a palette…
    - colormap: quasi-continuous → floating point number. 
  - How often do we update colormaps?
    - infinite colormaps?  
    - colormap packages?  
      - variations of colormaps…
      - better document register_colormap
        - in startup script or library init…
      - palettable: @todo link: https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/ 
    - make colormaps have info about themselves.
      - ie discrete, diverging, etcs
    - @todo cookie cutter for data file creation a colormap…
  - color cycles 
    - from discrete colormaps? 
# 27 Aug

  - all public API, would need to be shimmed out in refactor
- 11944 
  - needs backport?
  - needs verification with WX
- 11936
  - replacement except for thumbnail view (@Antony L just needs the CSS for that)



# 19 Aug 2018

@efiring, @tacaswell, @dopplershift, @anntzer, @jklymak

## Agenda
[x] How do we get 3.0 out the door?  What to do about the backend mess?
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11896
[x] [NF] Add 'truncate' and 'join' methods to colormaps. https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/7716
[x] PR Download jquery during build. https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11246
[x] [**BUG: correct the scaling in the floating-point slop test.**](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11591) ****https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11591


## Notes


- RC3.0r1 
  - Backend issue
    - inter-operability, packaging etc issue.  Patterns of usage. 
    - solve packaging issue with forcing packagers to choose a backend. 
- jquery 
  - @tacaswell to finish up…
- #
- 7716
  - make simpler interface and do some of work outside function
  - indexing w/ slices and lists
    - otherwise too complex.
  - direct indexing and floating point referencing.
    - difficult because cmaps take floats and integers now.  
  - Probably best to do as a documentation example of using `ListedColormap`  to do what this PR does.  @jklymak will write an example if something doesn’t exist.
- Scaling floating point
  - 3.1 or 3.0: 3.0  Approved after @efiring fix deprecation messages.

  - #11664 proposes *not* registering the pandas date converters and running tests on our own date converters instead.  Per discussion with pandas folks https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/10533 and https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10638, they want to *not* automatically register their converters on `import pandas`,  so we were moving towards making matplotlib converters work without needing their converters.  Given that it makes sense to not register their converters, and leave testing of their converters to pandas. 


## Notes


- SciPy debrief @Thomas C : 
  - Governance 
    - steering council Matplotlib
    - different than technical leadership
    - grants, 10000-foot view project
    - Code of conduct issues
    - commit bit decisions
    - cap on numbers i.e. five people
    - non-commit bit people on council (i.e. downstream consumers)
  - Finance committee w/ numfocus
    - new membership
    - meet regularly
  - Sprints
    - documentation overlap
      - canonical links in old docs.  More direction to top levels.
    - scrape archive for matplotlib
      - sort out matplotlib in them:  arAxiv  13% in last month ~2000 papers; grant draft.  Grant numbers?
  - Refactors
    - maybe in affiliated packages
    - structured data `xarray` and `dataframes`
    - numpy `dtypes` discussion: co-ordinated w/ numpy
    - `axes` and `pyplot` possibly legacy 
    - data “class”
    - better return types for children
      - more custom artists
      - draw tree:  high level and low level…
        - export to java script, and save to JSON etc…
    - traitlets
      - notify listeners.
      - Link to ipywidgets, 
      - tuned to ipython
      - maybe we need to implement our selves?
  - python-based configuration?
    - ipython does it: 
      - No ui can go in front
      - *Why?  Something like https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/7696 could work.  AL.*
    - jupyter
      - security?  Probably not an issue and switches…
    - can't programatically roundtrip
      - do we want?
      - *Is this true?  Can’t we just ensure that everything that goes to the rcParams has a correct (roundtripping) repr?  AL.*
- 2.2.3 this week
  - qt release breaks shims
  - no RC

## Notes

@efiring, @jklymak

- colormap/cm issue
  - old issue…
  - probably a good first step.  larger scale organization maybe for later…
- #11412: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11412
  - consisntency `contour` and `contourf`   
  - keep same number of levels even if no data when user specifies a level.
  - colors match up between fill and edge
    - levels and layers: color-mapping to layers.  levels and layers same for line contour…
- datalim/ apply aspect, sharex etc
  - apply_aspect can have impossible solns
    - works at draw time, and then tries to send info to shared axes….
    - has possible constrained_layout implications…
    - race conditions possible.
    - sharing across figures.  
      - resize figure, aspect ratio changes
      - datalim option to aspect is very tricky, especially when sharing…
      - add twinning: 
  - Limitations that are a problem…
    - question whether to special case some?  
  - Todo write tutorial: @jklymak
    - show simple API
    - show ways to get basic things done.  
- ENH add an inset_axes to the axes class #11026 
# 4 June 2018

  - do we want this?  Not attracting reviews…
- @Tim H naming issues? In particular the set_*lim parameter names #11293 
- @Tim H naming conventions re methods: maybe inset_axes_rect #11026.
## Notes

**Naming issues re xmin/xmax/limits**

- currently can use min/max or directional 
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11293#issuecomment-391438870
- don’t have two parameters with different names doing the same thing, but may not be a good idea to discard existing 
  - min/max is consistent with r/theta
  - directional  may be more strictly correct/accurate
  - replace name and use start/stop for everything
- @Eric F xlim/xmin/xmax are horrible:
  - xmin/xmax subset of xlim
  - min & max isn’t clear - positional or numerical - 
    - for cartesian axis left & right are correct and unambiguous
- @Eric F bbox methods confusing but use left, right, bottom, top
  - rlim directional would be inner/outer
  - theta lim - maybe use stop/start instead (would be consistent with normal range)
    - radial has clockwise and counterclockwise - figure out default direction?
- ToDo:
  - look at situation with polar plots
  - look at transforms see if change needed for API consistency
  - check with @Thomas C for thoughts
  - formal deprecation or informal deprecation in documentation (new standards)
    -  do a long term change in docs and warn people heavily - slow dep roll out

**Naming issues re methods**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11026#issuecomment-392315969
- use verbs that explain what the method is doing:
  - `make_inset_axes_rec`
- Alternative: `inset_axes_from_rect` (makes it clear that it’s not only returning a value because it’s creating “from the rect”.
# 27 May 2018
## Agenda
- ~~#6254 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/6254 quick review~~
- traitletts?  What is the path forward here?  
  - previous attempts tried to do all in one PR - seems impossible w/o freezing the rest of development.  Need a better strategy (or scrap idea?)
- switch meetings to  a hangout hosted by matplotlib@numfocus.org?
## Notes

**Traitlets**

  - `_traitlets/` submodule (?)
  - monkey patch into new modules as they are built out.
  - tried last summer, but didn’t get done…
  - month of full-time effort senior developer…
    - hard for nights and weekend…
    - could have a grant proposal
      - Sloan?  Moore, NSF Infastructure (Thomas can’t be on NSF grant)
      - Projects that look good - major change versus under the hood
      - Numfocus? 
      - institutional partner? BIDS?  
      - talk to Fernando Perez
    - Summer student?  
      - core library so maybe dangerous
    - Difficult to make sure consistency across classes
      - stakeholders
      - lots of cleanup along the way
      - Half-time buyout for senior developer?  
  - google stats, hits on documentation…
- ToDo:
  - start iterating through drafts of whitepapers/proposal drafts
  - https://vorpus.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-investment-in-open-source-infrastructure/
  - https://vorpus.org/blog/a-farewell-to-the-berkeley-institute-for-data-science/
  - https://github.com/tacaswell/mpl_grant (currently invite only)
  - Look at governance rules - assign owner to contentious PRs 

**3.0 timing:**

  - cut 3.0 in time for SciPy
  - approx. June 23 RC1 tagged
  - 3.0 July 8 final before SciPy

## Agenda
- 2.2.3?  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/milestone/34 
  - 3 outstanding PRs 1/2 approved.  A few issues.  
- image scaling: (attn @tacaswell)
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11047
- Should the docs pick up a `scipy` dependency for examples (to replace mlab) [[#11180](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11180)] ?
- get legend entries for scatter:
  - [#11127](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11127#discussion_r185030970) is there any clever way to extend this (up or down? i.e. should each artist have a label/artist creator, or should axes have special legend creators for different artist types?)
- DPI issues for hi-dpi and `fig.set_dpi` and `fig.dpi` inconsistencies…
  - [#11227](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11227), [#11232](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11232),  
- `ax.inset_axes` still needs review: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11026
## Notes

**2.2.3 out****standing PRs**

- 11062 - merged on rebase, all in new constrained layout
- 2.2.3 after jquery fix (11199)
- change in build strategy for 2.2.3 and long term to fix jquery
  - in sdist, but not repo; download at download time? Download sdist, not tarball
  - from pypi will be OK not GitHub for a single tar file
  - follow jupyter’s methodology
  - @Antony L in next month or so?  

**Scipy dependency**

- use for examples?  
  - Yes, but not in main codebase…  Travis tests always w/o scipy
- scipy readily available; annotate examples to make it clear its needed…
- pandas?
  - what about their plotting?  seaborn
  - add to examples to showoff pandas integration

**Leg****e****nd entry on PathCollecti****on**

  - good idea, parallels version on contours
  - concern that PathCollection used for other things
  - maybe add a ScatterAritist which is a subsclass of PathCollecion which adds this method (+ would help @Antony L with mpl cursor)

## Notes

**Repr vs. Str for Transforms**

- str same as repr is fine?  Best practice?  `__repr__` shorter….

**Unit property of Axis****:** attn ****@Ryan M ****

- go back to using different attribute to store mapping
- create attribute on unit that stores ordering string - unit.unit =
- fix overwriting the unit object by passing in the unit **kwarg
- general sense 
  - units are offsets + scaling factors or (days, minutes, etc. ) - unify inches and feets
  - data stylesheets - mapping data to floats (dates, times, strings)
  - user sets 
- two types of units:
  - kwarg unit - was stored in ax.unit, now clobbered my datatype unit
  - datatype - _unit
- should axis support floats even when locked?
  - @Jody K let the convertor decide
- internal data abstraction @tacaswell 
  - data objects attached to artist…
  - adaptive re-sampling
  - units handling on fly…  stores units.  

**OpenGL**

- graphics cards transform stack
- draw stack hard to plug that in w/o moving whole stack down

@Eric F @Jody K @Thomas C @paul h @hannah a 

## Agenda:
- py3 transition: 
  - [#11142](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11142) is this too aggressive?  makes for issues with PRs being able to be back ported to 2.2.3 - if we yank out all future imports etc how do we write PRs that can be ported to 2.2.x?
- Update: bbox issues: @jklymak:  
  - [#10682](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10682) updated to have `inbbox=True/False` parameter.
## Notes:

PY3 transition.

- @Thomas C wants to stand by the backport criteria (critical bugs and regressions), other backports need a champion.  
- 2.2.2 doc branch should only get changes to the .rst file, won’t see changes .py because of how docs are built

UpdateL bbox issues

- a`rtist.inbbox` flag - property on artist: 
  - when tight_layout does calculation, ignores everything set to False
  - pro: explicit listing of elements in bbox
  - con: @Eric F unintended consequences like possible performance issues? 
    - does everything need to be explicitly white/blacklisted?
    - goal for constraint layout to maybe be default?
    - GUIs need to be resized and so on the fly layout
    - @paul h suggests doing some benchmarks to see if performance is an issue
  -  @Thomas C what else could we use this flag for? semantic content of “I want this artist included in the bbox” - tight layout, constrained layout
  - sticky edge - when you change autoscaling to non-tight, but some artists need tight like imshow:
    - draw circle on image, will recognize that image wants tight
    - if circle>image, adds pad
  - clip paths - draw a line from [-10, 10], set limits to [-5, 5] , only see data in -5, 5 range, if you turn off then will show [-10,10] line
    - clip on -  yes/no clip flag
    - clib path - arbitrary path to clip to
    - clib box -if path rectangle, has some optimized code to make box
    - if child not clipped, will include as part of axes bbox
    - could check if clip box==axes box
  - axes bounding box = union of all clip objects, and objects outside that box get added in 
- maintain get_tightbox signature by removing:
- get_tightbox should stay on artists and do intersection in print, thereby deprecating extra artist

@efiring @jklymak, @story645, @dopplershift

## Agenda:
- bbox issues: @jklymak:
   `ax.get_tightbbox()`  now includes legends as of #9164 (and #10682 proposes making it that way for *all* artists).  But that is sometimes bad if the user has stuck the legend far from the axes (i.e. #11041).  @ImportanceOfBeingEearnest brought up the idea of having a flag attached to an artist that says whether it should be part of get_tightbbox, so users can turn it on/off on an as-needed basis.  
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/9130, https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9164, https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10682, https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11041
- inset_axes API:
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11026
- event tracking data in google analytics w/docs
  - https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events
## Notes:

**bbox_issues**

- previously: constraint/tight layout didn’t include legends
  - figure legends not in tight bbox? 
  - included when fig bbox=tight
  - not included in axes bbox
  - used in tight and constraint layout
  - artist property set to true by default, could be set to false by default
- should all artists be part of tight box? do we need method of exclusion?
  - @Eric F flag is low barrier, but is there enough use case?
  - current: legend based on bbox_to_anchor argument against existing axes
  - proposed exclusion methods:
    - method on artist: legend.exclude for bbox
    - kwarg to `constraint_layout`? 
  - alternatives for legends:
    - attach legend to its own axes and use that bbox
    - @use fig.legend + bbox transform
- @Jody K To Do: add exclusion flag
- @Eric F move automatic gathering of handles, labels into axes methods
  - do axes composition: axes.get_legend_entries in fig.axes
  - feed sum(handles, labels) into fig.legend()

**inset_axis**

- child axes
  - @Eric F want to preserve hierarchy/ composition
  - @Jody K needed for tight_layout/constrained_layout
  - tension w/ preserving axesgrid api:
    - axesgrid is poorly documented
  - multiple apis for add_inset:
    - manual, specify the box for the inset axis
    - loc based but needs height+width
    - padding? 
      - handled w/ uniform shrink (like colorbar)
      - pad in terms of physical units? @Jody K??
  - @Eric F : Start with simple api
    - specify rectangle and transform
    - @Jody K add_inset_rect + pad 
      - specify pad in  physical units

**API inconsistencies** 

  - @Eric F: importance of being earnest mentions inconsistency between text (x, y, text) and annotate takes (text, (x,y))
    - keep track of inconsistencies?
    - shift to a more uniform standard?
    - how to tabulate?
      - new github repo for program management?  https://github.com/matplotlib/ProjectManagement
        - add issues for api inconsistencies

**3.0 plan**

- aim is for SciPy: release 3.0
- point of 3.0 is mostly to get devs using Python 3.0 only version

- Documentation Summit: Who wants to come? (And where are you located?)
- PRs:
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11048
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11027
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11055
## Notes
- imshow Python refactor:
  - agg interpolation 
- 11027 - @Thomas C 
  - Add one more dial to automatic spacing based on font size
  - assuming x axis tick labels are wider than y axis - more ticks on y than x
  - wants algorithm to factor in when x is smaller - dynamic guessing of xtick size
  - adding unnecessary? complexity 
  - @Ryan M - subclass locator, make it first class citizen in library
  - @Antony L monkey patch axis api:
    - add public API to replace methods
    - tell user to subclass locator - have subclassing API
  -  set default axes for axis
  - @Eric F generalize API to accomplish same by making two new parameters:
    - x tick label size/ y tick label size - access to these properties
    - trying to estimate how large tick will be in axis dimension (based on character width and height, not fontsize)
    - Public API change to locator:
      - control multiples of x and y tick label size
      - heuristic is combining stuff from axis to locator
    - deprecate get_tick_space, replace with private method that 
      - gets length of tick in points
      - fontsize in points
      - locator can get axis object for axis names (x or y)
  - need easy way to subclass locators instead of having to subclass axis
- 11048 - @Thomas C 
  - move bar grouping out of hist into its own thing so that it can be a shared private function
  - add a plt.multibar/groupedbar to support multiple bars that can call bar underneath the hood
    - can prune some of the features of bar: no bottom, no alignment, 
    - grouping - by variable (y) or by x(category)
    - API design with no implementation first + how it’d be used by refactored hist
  - follow plot and pandas semantics with respect to broadcasting x to y: each column is a dataseries/variable
  - replace some of histograms logic with a call to multibar
  - @Eric F create a hierarchy of how the plots build on top of each other
  - bar charts x tick labels should probably be fixedlocator/fixedformatter by default
- 11055 
  - @Antony L easy to restore, unclear what it does, doesn’t think it works
  - @Ryan M conda-forge testing branch makes setup_cfg use the local freetype
  - use case: conda looks up listed packages, so you can run only the tests and install the test data, can check all the files that were installed and say “that’s my package” which is a test only package that only contains test results
  - newer versions of conda build can generate multiple packages out of one recipe
  - pitch it back to conda unless they ask about it?
- [+Documentation summit](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Documentation-summit-3HkbTDvrztZbmIm6wsC0B) 
  - Late Summer/Early Fall - 2-3 days
  - Manning people want long form narrative explaining step by step
  - thoughts
    - @Eric F - summer is better than fall (mid august)
    - @Antony L - intermediate level docs  (step function in documentation)
      - does this already exist?
      - defining what is intermediate? - @Antony L what is Python? what is matplotlib?

## Notes

**Inset_axes/spine tick stuff**

-  @Eric F spend time over the weekend reading through how tick code actually works and took notes.
-  @Jody K Currently we don’t have a notion of ‘nested’ axes, but that it would make sense to have ‘child’ axes that is follows the parent.  Thinking of these following axes an decorations on the parent axes (like legend) 
- @Eric F summary of history of axes_grid and friends
- discussion of what parts of axes_grid we can move up into the ‘mainline’ of the codebase
- @Eric F  - refactor and better document code to reduce technical debt? 
- @Eric F Cleaning up current ticker might be worth doing before we do whole-sale re-write
- @Eric F suggests that we accept more breakage of edge-case APIs for improved consistency,  
- trade off: replacing more complex with simpler 👍 , complex with complex 👎 
- @Thomas C sold on:
  - axes_inset as children of parent axes
  - more thought on axis children objects 
    - different x spine/multiple x spines 
    - facilitates hierarchical locating/labeling 
    - ticker - container for one formatter/locator
    - smarter ticker that can have sequence of :
      - spines, locators, formatters
    - thing that’s drawn: spine/tickers/formatters
    - axis: information about scale, patches, etc.
      - scale sets transform, default locator, formatter
      - blended scale - apply 
        - transform(y) to y data, 
        - transform(x) on x data
        -  separate transform for projection 
      - need full transform to do all ticks
    

**Wh****ere to put developer notes?**

  - add tutorial section for developers
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10947
  - Notes in progress?
    - @Antony L suggested the wiki
    - **Con****se****nsus** https://github.com/orgs/matplotlib/teams/developers

**Perez:** 

- possible rewrite pyplot with aim to more consistent input → output, state machine

**Gitwash/git workflow documentation**

- Find out who has push on it
- using it to standardize workflow across communities
- @Antony L suggesting we just link to central gitwash instead of bothering with templating
- @Tim H https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10997

**Mailing list:**

- @Jody K suggest automatic reply on rejected posts saying you have to join to post to the list

**Tool manager:**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9022 
- @Antony L - good idea but ToolBarManager should be moved out of core
- @Thomas C can’t be moved out ‘cause too coupled with GUI backends 
- @Jody K why ToolBarManager?
  - @Thomas C makes toolbar modular -can just add buttons for things like zoom and lasso
  - @Antony L adding buttons using homebuilt widget system → tool bar manager → write full blown QT GUI
  - @Antony L wants to know if it will be the full blown default or another axis_grid
  - backends: everything except WX (which is in PR)
- goal for 3, default in 3.1

# 2 Apr 2018 (Easter Monday)
[ ] Clarify MEP process
[ ] Tick refactor: 
  - (Timhoffm, but he has no email address to invite.)
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/5665#issuecomment-377269387
## Notes 2 Apr 2018

**MEP about MEP?** @Thomas C **will do book keeping tasks**

- When to write a MEP?
  - proposing controversial features, 
  - backward incompatible features
  - big new features/ major features
  - add to top of : https://matplotlib.org/devel/MEP/index.html
  - in readme.txt add link to MEP page
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/tree/master/doc/devel
- possibly update index with abstract info from MEP
- Style guide for MEPs
  - https://matplotlib.org/devel/MEP/template.html
- Where to discuss MEPS?
  - PR + DEV mailing list? 
  - numpy just had this discussion- ended up split between PR and mailing list
  - cross link wiki MEPs to PR MEPS, declare which is canonical version
  - PR to doc/devel/mep
- When proposing a MEP:
  1. do a small PR that adds your MEP to the master list (in https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/MEP/index.html),
  2. have another PR with the actual discussion.  Helps avoiding conflicting numbers.

**Need text/followup from** @Thomas C **on**

[x] summer student
[x] documentation summit
  

**Tick Refactor** @Tim H ****

- target 3.1
- MEP?
- concern about how much of the current flexibility do we actually use? 
- get buy in from cartopy and astropy/yt/wcsaxes/etc
- 3 phases to roll out (probably 2 year timeline):
  - old system as default + new as beta
  - new as default + old available
  - drop old system
- Figure out how much of the API changes/what public methods need to  dropped;
    - public api that predates __ convention
    - are ticks markers or line collections or something else?
    - gridlines are line collections/single broken line
    - @Antony L sketch: https://github.com/anntzer/matplotlib/tree/_wip/newaxis
    - how does it work with projections?
      - straight line in proj space or data space 
        - rader plots wants straight
        - other polar wants curved 
        - `l.get_path()._interpolation_steps = GRIDLINE_INTERPOLATION_STEPS` L505 in axis.py
    - how does it work with labeling?
      - correctly computing normals of the edge
    - Snapping:
      - have to snap ticks and axes border and girdlines
      - currently snap to closest pixel

**TextCollection? instead of list of Texts**

- text rendering may be slow because of rasterization of individual glyphs, but should be profiled
- might be good for completeness/API reasons
- @Ryan M scattertext WIP: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/4063
  - needs colormapping
- marker, patch and polycollection 
  - marker codepath/ in draw path:
    - if all markers same, draw once and stamp (draw marker path)
    - if one marker different, falls back on individual rendering (draw poly path)

# 26 Mar 2018
[ ] DateFormatter and Locator @Jody K 
  Do we want to update the default locator and ticks or just provide another Formatter option for savvy users? 
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10841
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9801
[ ] Google summer of code student
  - project?
[ ] Extra Ticks: 
  why do we need extra ticks around viewlims?  These end up causing headaches because they are not drawn, and their visible state is true (in master).  
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10881
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/10874
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9452
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/9397



## Notes: 26 Mar 2018
  - Antony, Hannah, Ryan, Jody

**Ticks**

  - issues with extra ticks outside viewlims.  Antony said they were due to roundoff errors.
  - maybe trim at Locator level. 
  - deprecate not visible:  
    - `ticker.Locator` would all need to change
    - deprecate out of range ticks first, and then expect proper list
    - epsilon out of viewlims?  Keep those.  
  - ticks and lines top and bottom: individual lines for each ticks.  
    - overhaul, single line for top and bottom ticks.  `LineCollection` for grids.
    - back compatibility?  Custom `Axes` subclass with new `Axis` subclass….
    - each line call is slow (units support).
    - speed benefit? 
    - can’t manipulate individual tick visibility.  

**Datetime formatting:**

  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10841
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9801
  - General agreement locator
  - General agreement formatter:
    - needs way to get old beghaviour
    - useful for teaching/default
  - @Antony L suggested naming convention
    - MPLxyDateFormatter
    - Alias AutoFormatter to current MPLXYDateFormatter
    - Document “We reserve right to change formatter”
  - deprecate old linear scalar formatter?

    - original inheritance from scalarmappable,  when colorbar is really dependent on the AxesImage/Scatter - change the mappable rather than colorbar
  - @Jody K made mock scalarmappable that can be deprecated
  - **Units issue discussion #13236**

- upper right is ambiguous ‘cause besides or on top of bunch of axis
- need centralized documentation of how it *should* be done, then can move towards doing it uniformly.

# 28 Jan 2019
## Agenda
[x] follow up on summer studentsReviews
  [x]  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12678 (fix for timezone handling)
  [x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13128 (Parameter renaming)
  [x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13069 (default minor ticker change)
  [ ] verbose/logging method: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13275 
## Notes
  - **Timezone handling**
-  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12678
- timezone information wasn’t being passed into YearLocator
- alternative is don’t support timezone/assume GMT
- without passing isdst, will raise exception if time being DST is ambiguous (no timezone passed in)
  - user can pass localtime instead of datetime 
  - `dateutil` might correctly handle this
  - this is in yearlocator
  - 
  - **Parameter renaming decorator**
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13128
- just waiting on @Thomas C 
- decorator to make functions keyword only?
  - later deprecate positional and make them kwarg only
    - would require making pyplot wrappers aware of deprecators
- merged
  - 
  - **Minor tick changer**
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13 069
- insist on backcompat api? 
- minor ticks not as commonly used, so should in theory have smaller ripple effects
- leave 1  and 10 at 5 ticks, because it yields a middle
  - 
  - **Verbose logging**
- requires multiple levels of hierarchies 
- need way to turn off mpl level logging w/o turning off other logging
  - can’t use global handler (basicconfig)
- handler needs to be publicly accessible
- this is designed for end (mostly novice) user, not library dev
  - needs to not cause ripple effects in downstream libraries/apps
  - **summer students**
- @hannah a spoke with geopandas, worried their project is not a full 3 months (but we suspect it is more complicated than they think)
- @Thomas C will send follow up email and include user list.
  - 
  - **Next release?**
- release bugfix 3.0.x soon and 3.1 in a month or so 
  - must already be in master to be considered for 3.1
- check in on https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13281
- @Thomas C will send email with announcement + asking for volunteers to help run release.
- get in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13030 (ping @Benjamin R)
  - 
  - **Units**
- @Antony L - datetime should be pitched to floats & stay there instead of mixed units
- places where you’d like to pitch stuff to numpy but as array destroys units (for example unwraps pint)

# 21 Jan  2019
## Agenda
[x] updates for NF annual report
    > Happy new year! We are hard at work producing the 2018 NumFOCUS Annual Report. Last year we invited all of our sponsored projects to include the main highlights of their year, and we'd like to do so again this year.
    > 
    > To keep things manageable with over 2 dozen projects, please reply to me with 2 or 3 bullet points of your 2018 highlights.
    > 
    > For example:
    > Received ACM Best Project Of All Time Award
    > Celebrated our 1.0 release
    > Brought on two new core developers, Jane Doe and John Hancock
    > Kindly send me your highlights by the end of this week if at all possible.
    > 
    > Let me know if you have any questions.
[ ] gsoc or JDH student fellowship this summer?
  [ ] if gsoc, then what should we do with JDH fellowship this year?
[ ] documentation summit
## Notes
  - **Numfocus Annual Report** @Thomas C **wrote it**
- I officially became lead developer, 3 new core developers (Tim Hoffman, Ernest, Dietmar Schwertberger)
- 200 unique code contributors for year (average ~26 unique contributors per month)
- One major release (3.0), one minor release (2.2), 8 total patch releases
- note about plotting contest & summer fellowship
  - **GSOC & JDH**
- pros: more control + good use of fellowship money
- cons: running ourselves, everyone stretched super thin
- Are there projects?
  - keep working on matplotlib altair - 
    - cons: altair is kinda dead, any mpl developer interest? 
  - propose there own projects
  - infrastructure:
    - proper webpage/documentation deployment
      - sphinx 
      - fix doc version selection - version toggle
      - google pointing to outdated docs
      - which HTMLs are associated to each other, or clean versioning 
      - python has instructions somewhere for building versioning? 
      - needs mentor 
  - put out call to devel mailing list for mentors/projects
    - run it through gsoc if mentors are new
  - models of good projects:
    - astropy, sympy
    - clear projects, milestones, fairly self contained
  - outside matplotlib + mpl related
    - fix viz in geopandas @hannah a would mentor, need run by geopandas
    - cartopy - @Ryan M & Elliot have commit bits so stuff could go in
    - factor out pandas plotting into its own package - kinda becomes matplotlib toolkit 
      - @Thomas C maybe, @hannah a maybe
    - factor out xarray plotting into its own package/clean up their visualization 
      - @Thomas C maybe, @hannah a maybe
    - seems to be an interest in geospatial / mapping extensions
    - list of things basemap can do that cartopy:
      - besides labeling lines
      - migrating basemap to cartopy
        - convert basemap examples to cartopy 
        
  - **Depr****e****cated/closed MEPS**
- MEP 25 (closed #3424)
- MEP 26 
  - 
  - **Discussion about webpage**
- looking into ways to get redirect of main page like python.org  (https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html = https://docs.python.org/library/index.html)
- bandwidth cloudflare - 2 Tb/month (780k unique users)
- each version 250 Mb - doc repo about 10 Gb.
  - **documentation summit**
- @Ryan M can host
- $13k  budget + small grant ($3k from numfocus)
  - 2 days, 5 - 7 travelers?
    - Have to be there: @Ryan M @Eric F @Thomas C 
    - probably: @hannah a + Dora
    - who else? post to mailing list
  - budget for flights + hotel + food 
  - work product is proposal to ask funding agency for technical writer
    - scope of work
    - milestones
    - what the document looks like in the end - (kinda like book proposal??)
  - usability issues seem to be more due to docs than code base?
  - sort out how to call people in
- possibly combine with steering council meeting (Ryan, Tom, Eric)
- last week of may/ first week of June
  - 
# 14 Jan 2019
## Agenda
[ ] Merging policy clarification 
[ ] how eager should units conversion be for x+dx (ie bar(x, width))? 
    -  Eager makes our lives easier but doesn’t allow combining units that will add but may have different converters (timedelta, datetime). https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/issues/751
    - Exactly what types are allowed as input?  `[], [unit-y objects (i.e. numbers, strings, datetimes)], np.ndarray, np.ma, unit-wrapper(np.ndarray)``,  pandas.Series`
      - documentation issue, we should specify what inputs are allowed for tuples, and what properties they must satisfy. 
[ ] scipy 2019 talk + tutorial
  [ ] @Benjamin R is not planning to go to SciPy this year, @hannah a has volunteered to teach intro-to-matplotlib tutorial
  [ ] should we put in for the interactive one as well?
  [ ] do we want to give a talk?
  - 
## Notes
  - 
  - **Merging**
- need to balance review strictness versus getting things merged…
- test suite not perfect and not complete
- cleanups can miss corner cases
- for core devs, make objections explicit
- more aggressive use of ‘request changes’ (red x) on review when you want:
  - changes to the PR
  - indicate that you want to close the PR, with timeline
  -  to have sign off on the PR getting merged
- use comment (no approve/reject) to not sign on as a full reviewer? 
- @Antony L proposal for core devs: 
  - if PR has one positive review & it’s been two weeks, ping devs for review
  - if month of no comment, can be merged
  - each dev can sponsor one review at a time
  - reviewers can say needs more review
  - @Jody K needs 100% code coverage 
- 2nd reviewer can just scan  & merge
## unit 
  - 
  - conversion:
- **containers**: arrays, lists, dictviews
- **datatype**: int, float, string, bool, datetime
- container specification of supported operators:
  - must be singleton/iterable 
    - unit aware asarray w/o data duplication + dictview support
  - something that we can call asarray on + dictviews
  - but will do unit support first (numpy strips up units)
- datatype specification of support on operators:
  - unit registry/unit specs out how datatype works
  - convertible to/from float
  - write timedelta convertor? 
- data wrapper object vs fixing units in numpy
  - FOH: unit work
  - BOH: use arrays for things
  - only duplicate memory if you’re using units? 
- **TODO**:
  - document expected unit containers
  - test united data
## SciPy
- modified Anatomy of Matplotlib by @hannah a 
  - needs assistants
## Students
- maybe @Antony L answering questions
- what sorts of projects? stand alone/isolated/doable
- low stakes, standalone, halfway done
  - discrete legend
  - colorbar refactor
  - VR  backend 
  - fix geopandas viz/other 3rd party matplotlib viz projects? 
  -

  - in coord format?  Category
- going in circles about how to support both the naive user which is getting things-that-work-but-are-not-what-they-want vs non-naive users who are get spurious errors for correct usage of the library (sorry for cynical summary).
- more general discussion about helping users with common pitfalls
  - plt.helpful → set logging level to Info for matplotlib.
- maybe we can just use logging.info?
- Settled on using logging
  - @Jody K will change #13026 to use logging
  - someone will open a PR to add a helper function to pyplot (and/or top-level ?) to set up the logging at info level.

# 3 Dec 2018
## Agenda
[ ] Testing: drop 3.5?  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12538
  [ ] Do we need Azure and all the Travis runs?  
[ ] Performance profiling: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12915  Can we have a proper profiling test?  Seems maybe some import profiling is happening that tests pathological import cases.  
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10841 ping @efiring (New date formatter)
  [ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12909 Format all ticks at once.  (Should go in before above?)
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12903  Units math…
  - 
## Notes
  - **testing drop 3.5?**
- numpy 1.11 minimum
- still need mac and pc on Azure before switching
  - **profiling - optimizing imports and the like** 
- low hanging fruit
- straight python work - maybe good first issue? 
  - **12909: formatters formatting all ticks at once**
- creates method for running list comprehension over list of ticks
  - **isinstance in formatters?** 
- checking for membership in class and not documenting @Eric F 
- API change w/ no note change 
  - **12903: time has datetime + time delta**
- categories has literals and float delta (for spacing ‘cause of cat→int mapping)
- tries to directly do math on values (like a time delta) because axis supports it
  - default to overloaded class methods (like +, -)
- falls back on calling convert on values if [+- not overloaded](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/not-overloaded-GwKLO91ub6MVrkm1BVKru) 
  - **WIP fall off dates,  policy on closing old PRs**
- needs revision/needs adoption 
- label clean ups
  - **documentation sprint**
- sort out what to write for grant to hire full time technical writer for a year 
- write a 2 page Work Plan for sprint -@hannah by end of January 
  - what we want to get out of it
    - better scoping of matplotlib
    - example: concrete data driven examples vs. random numbers
  - who wants to come/interested in coming 
- numpy small grants- apply 
- Boulder as location  @Ryan M 
- work around academic schedules 
- Overhaul and revise documentation
- need to include information about visualization basics (not mpl specific)
- more toy-datasets rather than random data
  - **TODO: ALL THE GOVERNANCE THINGS -** @Thomas C ****@Eric F ****@Ryan M ****

    - proposals can be a bit boiler-platable.  
# #12 Nov 2018
## Agenda
[ ] Admin backlog 
  [ ] Governance
  [ ] Swag logo (numfocus email)
    What version of the Matplotlib logo would you want featured on the shop? I was thinking it might be nice to use one that actually says "Matplotlib," but the only file I have like that is very long and narrow and the font is sort of odd.
    Do you want us to come up with something on your behalf? Is just the circle logo okay?
  [ ] Community outreach 
## Notes

# 05 Nov 2018
## Agenda
[x] Other 3.0.x https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/milestone/39
[ ] Github policies and best practices:
  [ ] cleaning up old issues w/ no feedback 
  [ ] user help versus actual issue…
[ ] Doc builds
## Notes
  - **Azure:**
- need to find way of copying permissions over: no group privileges…
- may take over some of the testing from Travis.
  - **github policy** 
- bot - we think this has gone silent, after n weeks bot will close, reopen on interest
- at least one round of conversation
  - invite them to close themselves, “think this is not a bug because X” 
    - use “needs confirmation” tag
    - support: stack overflow, mailing list, gitter
- bug reports are self selecting/small chunk of things people fine
  - can assign teasing out the question issues to @hannah a 
  - **docs deploy cycle**
- auto building of docs not set up
- circle CI config 
- or @Elch R can do it manually more often
- docs organization:
  - matplotlib.org/rendered docs: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.github.com
  - pipeline: 
    - website gets published to top level
    - matplotlib.org/version gets to version docs
    - matplotlib.org/project yields project docs - manually c&p’ed by maintainers
- possibly use submodules to refactor: https://help.github.com/articles/using-submodules-with-pages/
  - top level is current
  - submodules for old versions
  - submodules for externel projects (their existing repos)
  - can use git-filter tree to maintain history

[ ] Matplotlib.use() after `import matplotlib.pyplot`: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12608
[ ] Test coverage?  How fussy do we want to be? 
[ ] Other 3.0.x https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/milestone/39
[ ] `_hold` issue… 
  - 
## Notes
- builds: 
  - windows via volunteer
  - mac/linux  https://github.com/MacPython/matplotlib-wheels and https://matplotlib.org/devel/release_guide.html#building-binaries
- Mac Framework
  - working for pypy is a future feature, so push to 3.1
- `Matplotlib.use`
  - merged.  Monitor for possible failure modes?  
- squash and merge backports
  - why not squash and merge?  Users get confused because there is no record that the branch has been merged….
  - squashing helps make sure malicious commits not snuck in.
- #12641 Drop asarray and c[0] (indexing on first element) because breaks units and doesn’t quite work on pandas data frames? 
- #12651 
- #12655 - data has bad values/overflow error -

      - ping that reviewer if two others have approved
      - explain why it’s rejected 
        - close if outright don’t want in 
    - no reject button:
      - check if other comments have handled

## Agenda:
  - 
[ ] Py3.5 in 3.1? 
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11711 lazy eval colors
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/milestones/v3.0.x
[ ] API changes level of detail.  Mechanism for enforcing…  i.e. numpy is more concise (?)
## Notes
- went through some v3.0.x PRs.  Nov 3 weekend first w/e @tacaswell can get to it
- Py 3.5
  - schedule is for dropping for 3.1
  - need a good reason for dropping;
  - Bug fix policy….
    - don’t have people to maintain too many bug fix branches
    - can backport critical bugs
  - Features in python that are worth doing
    - kw-only arguments 
    - kw-argument order: API can be cleaned up (i.e. color, facecolor, do in order they came in).  
  - Default packages don’t include new versions of matplotlib…
  - Solutions for upgrading python are much better than before…
  - communication downstream:
    - user and devel list (@tacaswell)

# 1 Oct 2018
## Agenda
[ ] Stale PR mechanism?  https://github.com/apps/stale, astropy has hand-built version.  Let more people tag?  More people close issues?  https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/11326
[ ] More get_tightbbox including artists that are not meant to be included.  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12256
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9565: How to deprecate the return value from `stem` method?  
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12312
  - 
## Notes
  - 
- still need to resolve how to move #9565 forward….
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12312
  - arbitrary scale needed?  
  - colorbars need some clean up still
- powernorm issue
- For annotate and ax.legend consider adding `in_layout=` kwarg…. TODO: @jklymak 
- PR Stale:
  - concerns about politeness
  - maybe adds noise 
  - need to encourage a culture of closing issues. 
  - Didn’t talk about letting more people close issues.

[ ] 3.0.x bugs: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/milestone/37
  - 
  - 
## Notes:
- because of https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12213 we should release 3.0.1 pretty soon.  And https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12177
  -  [#12173](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12173) might not just be windows.  
  - @efiring indicated that maybe on MacOSX as well
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/9485 perhaps also relevant.
- Sphinx issue

# 17 Sep 2018
## Agenda
[ ] tick locators.  Why return bracketing values?   Why worry about pixel size? https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12105 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11004
[ ] Date Formatter: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10841  Path to acceptance?  Pros better. Cons, API change
  - 
## Notes
- tick locators:
  - old was based on ticks rather than margins
  - half pixel to reduce fiddling
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1310
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/1686
  - seem to have conflicting requirements
    - on one hand we want to make the locators more separable from axis
    - on the other hand we want may need to have access to the scales to work in pixel space so we need
  - @Jody K ‘s PR moves the ‘pixel’ level clipping to the Axis object rather than the the locator
  - Maybe keep extra ticks but trim in `axis.py`
  - Ticks kept and removed…  ticks not drawn versus not created confusing
  - TODO: look at log locators; check axis API.  Check drawing / having extra ticks…
- Date locator:
  - TODO: localization
  - 
- Proposal: 
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10928
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10411/files should maybe be merged / done as part of / after proprocess data (not before).
  - @Thomas C is on board with this.
# 10 Sep 2018
## Agenda
[ ] Backend continues:  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11962
[ ] jquery: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11246  
  [ ] needs caching in place?
[x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12012 Fallback renderer for text (just like we did for legend)
[x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11966  Cartopy was using private method.  Fix already in master for cartopy.  
[ ] color sequence management and colormaps:
  - see https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12009 New Tableau colormaps.
  - what is level for adding new colormap
  - how do we go from colormap to color cycles?
  - better advertisement  of packages that provide more colormaps or add such a repository to the matplotlib tree?  i.e `cmocean`
[x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12037 artist.get_aliases  API change…
[ ] PR https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11936 sphinx-exhibit
[x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/10948 OS/X backend deprecation warning  for event_notify:
  [x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12053  merged
  - 
## Notes
  - 
- backend issue: needs another review
- jquery
  - not actually all that urgent. 
  - might be moot when `ipympl` gets going and replaced `nbagg`…
  - still relevant for webagg
- Renderer issues for get_window_extent
  - mixed-mode renderer needs to specify renderer
  - just always fallback to figure renderer?  
  - too much implicitness…
  - but artists can’t move between figures.  So each artist has a figure…
  - force draw after saving…
  - all caches onto figure and off individual figures…  
  - renderer=None → cahced renderer
  - instantiate a renderer at figure creation?
    - svg, pdf, only created when saving figure…
      - they use agg etc 
      - but if initialized w/ pdf tight_layout etc don’t work??
    - get_window_extent screen space…
- Cartopy GeoAxes
  - lost `._subplot_classes`  but Cartopy pre-master still uses it.  
  - @Antony L and @Thomas C looking at it.
- Colormaps, color cycles, palettes, style sheets 
  - merging colormaps and palettes?  Keep separate? 
    - palette: discrete set of colors
      - discrete lines and areas
      - flag is really a palette…
    - colormap: quasi-continuous → floating point number. 
  - How often do we update colormaps?
    - infinite colormaps?  
    - colormap packages?  
      - variations of colormaps…
      - better document register_colormap
        - in startup script or library init…
      - palettable: @todo link: https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/ 
    - make colormaps have info about themselves.
      - ie discrete, diverging, etcs
    - @todo cookie cutter for data file creation a colormap…
  - color cycles 
    - from discrete colormaps?

## Notes
  - 
- RC3.0r1 
  - Backend issue
    - inter-operability, packaging etc issue.  Patterns of usage. 
    - solve packaging issue with forcing packagers to choose a backend. 
- jquery 
  - @tacaswell to finish up…
- #
- 7716
  - make simpler interface and do some of work outside function
  - indexing w/ slices and lists
    - otherwise too complex.
  - direct indexing and floating point referencing.
    - difficult because cmaps take floats and integers now.  
  - Probably best to do as a documentation example of using `ListedColormap`  to do what this PR does.  @jklymak will write an example if something doesn’t exist.
- Scaling floating point
  - 3.1 or 3.0: 3.0  Approved after @efiring fix deprecation messages.
# 30 July 2018

## Agenda
- Eight 3.0 PRs: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3Av3.0
  - ~~https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11672  : Trivial please merge~~
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11637 : API changes (release work)
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11600 : backend switching: @Tim H has some concerns, but we should probably bite bullet and merge (2 approvals)
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11234 : `fig.add_artist`  Needs second review; ready to merge
  - ~~https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10886 : Not sure what this is, and why its needed~~ @Antony L  remilestoned by AL
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11026 : `ax.inset_axes` bringing functionality over from `axes_grid`.  One approval
  -   https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10691 : needs second review.  Makes shared axes ticks follow each other.  Requesting from @Eric F 
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10513#pullrequestreview-137499525 : file encoding changes @Antony L .  Needs second approval
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9084 : py3 @Antony L dealing with `_proxy`.
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/8951 : qt changes to mix blit and redraw @Antony L 
- pandas datetime integration revisit
  - See https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11664 and associated issues
  - #11664 proposes *not* registering the pandas date converters and running tests on our own date converters instead.  Per discussion with pandas folks https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/10533 and https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10638, they want to *not* automatically register their converters on `import pandas`,  so we were moving towards making matplotlib converters work without needing their converters.  Given that it makes sense to not register their converters, and leave testing of their converters to pandas.

## Notes
  - 
- SciPy debrief @Thomas C : 
  - Governance 
    - steering council Matplotlib
    - different than technical leadership
    - grants, 10000-foot view project
    - Code of conduct issues
    - commit bit decisions
    - cap on numbers i.e. five people
    - non-commit bit people on council (i.e. downstream consumers)
  - Finance committee w/ numfocus
    - new membership
    - meet regularly
  - Sprints
    - documentation overlap
      - canonical links in old docs.  More direction to top levels.
    - scrape archive for matplotlib
      - sort out matplotlib in them:  arAxiv  13% in last month ~2000 papers; grant draft.  Grant numbers?
  - Refactors
    - maybe in affiliated packages
    - structured data `xarray` and `dataframes`
    - numpy `dtypes` discussion: co-ordinated w/ numpy
    - `axes` and `pyplot` possibly legacy 
    - data “class”
    - better return types for children
      - more custom artists
      - draw tree:  high level and low level…
        - export to java script, and save to JSON etc…
    - traitlets
      - notify listeners.

      - *Why?  Something like https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/7696 could work.  AL.*
    - jupyter
      - security?  Probably not an issue and switches…
    - can't programatically roundtrip
      - do we want?
      - *Is this true?  Can’t we just ensure that everything that goes to the rcParams has a correct (roundtripping) repr?  AL.*

- revive matplotlib dev mailing list
- naming conventions
- new major feature; how to make a namespace package
  - easier for 3.0
- relaxing object-orientation…
  - make plotting functions that take an axes rather than axes methods
  - current way barrier to other projects who want to add their own plot functionality
  - how to pass `ax` argument to such functions
    surface.pcolor(ax, x, y, z)
    surface.pcolor(x, y, z, ax=ax)
  - decorators to supply pyplot-like interface? context manager? i.e.

## Agenda
- PR https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11127 still needs second review
- PR https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10682 :
  - `ax.get_tightbbox` includes *all* axes artists by default
  - new `artist.set_in_layout` meallow artists to opt out of layout 
  - big PR, but mostly because piecemeal implementation has been refactored to one place. (ie. `savefig('name.png', bbox_inches='tight')` uses the same algorithm as `get_tightbbox` now, whereas before they did not

## Notes
  - @efiring, @jklymak
- colormap/cm issue
  - old issue…
  - probably a good first step.  larger scale organization maybe for later…
- #11412: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11412
  - consisntency `contour` and `contourf`   
  - keep same number of levels even if no data when user specifies a level.
  - colors match up between fill and edge
    - levels and layers: color-mapping to layers.  levels and layers same for line contour…
- datalim/ apply aspect, sharex etc
  - apply_aspect can have impossible solns
    - works at draw time, and then tries to send info to shared axes….
    - has possible constrained_layout implications…
    - race conditions possible.
    - sharing across figures.  
      - resize figure, aspect ratio changes
      - datalim option to aspect is very tricky, especially when sharing…
      - add twinning: 
  - Limitations that are a problem…
    - question whether to special case some?  
  - Todo write tutorial: @jklymak
    - show simple API
    - show ways to get basic things done.  
- ENH add an inset_axes to the axes class #11026 
# 4 June 2018
- Scatter legend handler
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11127
- DPI issues for hi-dpi and `fig.set_dpi` and `fig.dpi` inconsistencies…
  - [#11227](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11227), [#11232](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11232),
- @Jody K Methods to organize plotting hierarchy: #11026, #11010, #11234
  - Note new project aimed at axes_grid1 harmonization: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/projects/9
  - do we want this?  Not attracting reviews…
- @Tim H naming issues? In particular the set_*lim parameter names #11293 
- @Tim H naming conventions re methods: maybe inset_axes_rect #11026.
## Notes
  - **Naming issues re xmin/xmax/limits**
- currently can use min/max or directional 
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11293#issuecomment-391438870
- don’t have two parameters with different names doing the same thing, but may not be a good idea to discard existing 
  - min/max is consistent with r/theta
  - directional  may be more strictly correct/accurate
  - replace name and use start/stop for everything
- @Eric F xlim/xmin/xmax are horrible:
  - xmin/xmax subset of xlim
  - min & max isn’t clear - positional or numerical - 
    - for cartesian axis left & right are correct and unambiguous
- @Eric F bbox methods confusing but use left, right, bottom, top
  - rlim directional would be inner/outer
  - theta lim - maybe use stop/start instead (would be consistent with normal range)
    - radial has clockwise and counterclockwise - figure out default direction?
- ToDo:
  - look at situation with polar plots
  - look at transforms see if change needed for API consistency
  - check with @Thomas C for thoughts
  - formal deprecation or informal deprecation in documentation (new standards)
    -  do a long term change in docs and warn people heavily - slow dep roll out
  - **Naming issues re methods**
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11026#issuecomment-392315969
- use verbs that explain what the method is doing:
  - `make_inset_axes_rec`
- Alternative: `inset_axes_from_rect` (makes it clear that it’s not only returning a value because it’s creating “from the rect”.
# 27 May 2018
## Agenda
- ~~#6254 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/6254 quick review~~
- traitletts?  What is the path forward here?  
  - previous attempts tried to do all in one PR - seems impossible w/o freezing the rest of development.  Need a better strategy (or scrap idea?)
- switch meetings to  a hangout hosted by matplotlib@numfocus.org?
## Notes
  - **Traitlets**
  - `_traitlets/` submodule (?)
  - monkey patch into new modules as they are built out.
  - tried last summer, but didn’t get done…
  - month of full-time effort senior developer…
    - hard for nights and weekend…
    - could have a grant proposal
      - Sloan?  Moore, NSF Infastructure (Thomas can’t be on NSF grant)
      - Projects that look good - major change versus under the hood
      - Numfocus? 
      - institutional partner? BIDS?  
      - talk to Fernando Perez
    - Summer student?  
      - core library so maybe dangerous
    - Difficult to make sure consistency across classes
      - stakeholders
      - lots of cleanup along the way
      - Half-time buyout for senior developer?  
  - google stats, hits on documentation…
- ToDo:
  - start iterating through drafts of whitepapers/proposal drafts
  - https://vorpus.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-investment-in-open-source-infrastructure/
  - https://vorpus.org/blog/a-farewell-to-the-berkeley-institute-for-data-science/
  - https://github.com/tacaswell/mpl_grant (currently invite only)
  - Look at governance rules - assign owner to contentious PRs 
  - 
  - **3.0 timing:**
  - cut 3.0 in time for SciPy
  - approx. June 23 RC1 tagged
  - 3.0 July 8 final before SciPy

## Agenda
- 2.2.3?  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/milestone/34 
  - 3 outstanding PRs 1/2 approved.  A few issues.  
- image scaling: (attn @tacaswell)
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11047
- Should the docs pick up a `scipy` dependency for examples (to replace mlab) [[#11180](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11180)] ?
- get legend entries for scatter:
  - [#11127](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11127#discussion_r185030970) is there any clever way to extend this (up or down? i.e. should each artist have a label/artist creator, or should axes have special legend creators for different artist types?)
- DPI issues for hi-dpi and `fig.set_dpi` and `fig.dpi` inconsistencies…
  - [#11227](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11227), [#11232](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11232),  
- `ax.inset_axes` still needs review: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11026
## Notes
  - 
  - **2.2.3 out****standing PRs**
- 11062 - merged on rebase, all in new constrained layout
- 2.2.3 after jquery fix (11199)
- change in build strategy for 2.2.3 and long term to fix jquery
  - in sdist, but not repo; download at download time? Download sdist, not tarball
  - from pypi will be OK not GitHub for a single tar file
  - follow jupyter’s methodology
  - @Antony L in next month or so?  
  - 
  - **Scipy dependency**
- use for examples?  
  - Yes, but not in main codebase…  Travis tests always w/o scipy
- scipy readily available; annotate examples to make it clear its needed…
- pandas?
  - what about their plotting?  seaborn
  - add to examples to showoff pandas integration
  - **Leg****e****nd entry on PathCollecti****on**
  - good idea, parallels version on contours
  - concern that PathCollection used for other things
  - maybe add a ScatterAritist which is a subsclass of PathCollecion which adds this method (+ would help @Antony L with mpl cursor)

## Notes
  - **Repr vs. Str for Transforms**
- str same as repr is fine?  Best practice?  `__repr__` shorter….
  - **Unit property of Axis****:** attn ****@Ryan M ****
- go back to using different attribute to store mapping
- create attribute on unit that stores ordering string - unit.unit =
- fix overwriting the unit object by passing in the unit **kwarg
- general sense 
  - units are offsets + scaling factors or (days, minutes, etc. ) - unify inches and feets
  - data stylesheets - mapping data to floats (dates, times, strings)
  - user sets 
- two types of units:
  - kwarg unit - was stored in ax.unit, now clobbered my datatype unit
  - datatype - _unit
- should axis support floats even when locked?
  - @Jody K let the convertor decide
- internal data abstraction @tacaswell 
  - data objects attached to artist…
  - adaptive re-sampling
  - units handling on fly…  stores units.  
  - **OpenGL**
- graphics cards transform stack
- draw stack hard to plug that in w/o moving whole stack down

## Agenda:
- py3 transition: 
  - [#11142](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11142) is this too aggressive?  makes for issues with PRs being able to be back ported to 2.2.3 - if we yank out all future imports etc how do we write PRs that can be ported to 2.2.x?
- Update: bbox issues: @jklymak:  
  - [#10682](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10682) updated to have `inbbox=True/False` parameter.
## Notes:
  - PY3 transition.
- @Thomas C wants to stand by the backport criteria (critical bugs and regressions), other backports need a champion.  
- 2.2.2 doc branch should only get changes to the .rst file, won’t see changes .py because of how docs are built
  - UpdateL bbox issues
- a`rtist.inbbox` flag - property on artist: 
  - when tight_layout does calculation, ignores everything set to False
  - pro: explicit listing of elements in bbox
  - con: @Eric F unintended consequences like possible performance issues? 
    - does everything need to be explicitly white/blacklisted?
    - goal for constraint layout to maybe be default?
    - GUIs need to be resized and so on the fly layout
    - @paul h suggests doing some benchmarks to see if performance is an issue
  -  @Thomas C what else could we use this flag for? semantic content of “I want this artist included in the bbox” - tight layout, constrained layout
  - sticky edge - when you change autoscaling to non-tight, but some artists need tight like imshow:
    - draw circle on image, will recognize that image wants tight
    - if circle>image, adds pad
  - clip paths - draw a line from [-10, 10], set limits to [-5, 5] , only see data in -5, 5 range, if you turn off then will show [-10,10] line
    - clip on -  yes/no clip flag
    - clib path - arbitrary path to clip to
    - clib box -if path rectangle, has some optimized code to make box
    - if child not clipped, will include as part of axes bbox
    - could check if clip box==axes box
  - axes bounding box = union of all clip objects, and objects outside that box get added in 
- maintain get_tightbox signature by removing:
- get_tightbox should stay on artists and do intersection in print, thereby deprecating extra artist

  - @efiring @jklymak, @story645, @dopplershift
## Agenda:
- bbox issues: @jklymak:
   `ax.get_tightbbox()`  now includes legends as of #9164 (and #10682 proposes making it that way for *all* artists).  But that is sometimes bad if the user has stuck the legend far from the axes (i.e. #11041).  @ImportanceOfBeingEearnest brought up the idea of having a flag attached to an artist that says whether it should be part of get_tightbbox, so users can turn it on/off on an as-needed basis.  
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/9130, https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9164, https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10682, https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11041
- inset_axes API:
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11026
- event tracking data in google analytics w/docs
  - https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events
## Notes:
  - **bbox_issues**
- previously: constraint/tight layout didn’t include legends
  - figure legends not in tight bbox? 
  - included when fig bbox=tight
  - not included in axes bbox
  - used in tight and constraint layout
  - artist property set to true by default, could be set to false by default
- should all artists be part of tight box? do we need method of exclusion?
  - @Eric F flag is low barrier, but is there enough use case?
  - current: legend based on bbox_to_anchor argument against existing axes
  - proposed exclusion methods:
    - method on artist: legend.exclude for bbox
    - kwarg to `constraint_layout`? 
  - alternatives for legends:
    - attach legend to its own axes and use that bbox
    - @use fig.legend + bbox transform
- @Jody K To Do: add exclusion flag
- @Eric F move automatic gathering of handles, labels into axes methods
  - do axes composition: axes.get_legend_entries in fig.axes
  - feed sum(handles, labels) into fig.legend()
  - **inset_axis**
- child axes
  - @Eric F want to preserve hierarchy/ composition
  - @Jody K needed for tight_layout/constrained_layout
  - tension w/ preserving axesgrid api:
    - axesgrid is poorly documented
  - multiple apis for add_inset:
    - manual, specify the box for the inset axis
    - loc based but needs height+width
    - padding? 
      - handled w/ uniform shrink (like colorbar)
      - pad in terms of physical units? @Jody K??
  - @Eric F : Start with simple api
    - specify rectangle and transform
    - @Jody K add_inset_rect + pad 
      - specify pad in  physical units
  - **API inconsistencies** 
  - @Eric F: importance of being earnest mentions inconsistency between text (x, y, text) and annotate takes (text, (x,y))
    - keep track of inconsistencies?
    - shift to a more uniform standard?
    - how to tabulate?
      - new github repo for program management?  https://github.com/matplotlib/ProjectManagement
        - add issues for api inconsistencies
  - **3.0 plan**
- aim is for SciPy: release 3.0
- point of 3.0 is mostly to get devs using Python 3.0 only version

## Notes
- imshow Python refactor:
  - agg interpolation 
- 11027 - @Thomas C 
  - Add one more dial to automatic spacing based on font size
  - assuming x axis tick labels are wider than y axis - more ticks on y than x
  - wants algorithm to factor in when x is smaller - dynamic guessing of xtick size
  - adding unnecessary? complexity 
  - @Ryan M - subclass locator, make it first class citizen in library
  - @Antony L monkey patch axis api:
    - add public API to replace methods
    - tell user to subclass locator - have subclassing API
  -  set default axes for axis
  - @Eric F generalize API to accomplish same by making two new parameters:
    - x tick label size/ y tick label size - access to these properties
    - trying to estimate how large tick will be in axis dimension (based on character width and height, not fontsize)
    - Public API change to locator:
      - control multiples of x and y tick label size
      - heuristic is combining stuff from axis to locator
    - deprecate get_tick_space, replace with private method that 
      - gets length of tick in points
      - fontsize in points
      - locator can get axis object for axis names (x or y)
  - need easy way to subclass locators instead of having to subclass axis
- 11048 - @Thomas C 
  - move bar grouping out of hist into its own thing so that it can be a shared private function
  - add a plt.multibar/groupedbar to support multiple bars that can call bar underneath the hood
    - can prune some of the features of bar: no bottom, no alignment, 
    - grouping - by variable (y) or by x(category)
    - API design with no implementation first + how it’d be used by refactored hist
  - follow plot and pandas semantics with respect to broadcasting x to y: each column is a dataseries/variable
  - replace some of histograms logic with a call to multibar
  - @Eric F create a hierarchy of how the plots build on top of each other
  - bar charts x tick labels should probably be fixedlocator/fixedformatter by default
- 11055 
  - @Antony L easy to restore, unclear what it does, doesn’t think it works
  - @Ryan M conda-forge testing branch makes setup_cfg use the local freetype
  - use case: conda looks up listed packages, so you can run only the tests and install the test data, can check all the files that were installed and say “that’s my package” which is a test only package that only contains test results
  - newer versions of conda build can generate multiple packages out of one recipe
  - pitch it back to conda unless they ask about it?
- [+Documentation summit](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Documentation-summit-3HkbTDvrztZbmIm6wsC0B) 
  - Late Summer/Early Fall - 2-3 days
  - Manning people want long form narrative explaining step by step
  - thoughts
    - @Eric F - summer is better than fall (mid august)
    - @Antony L - intermediate level docs  (step function in documentation)
      - does this already exist?

## Notes
  - **Inset_axes/spine tick stuff**
-  @Eric F spend time over the weekend reading through how tick code actually works and took notes.
-  @Jody K Currently we don’t have a notion of ‘nested’ axes, but that it would make sense to have ‘child’ axes that is follows the parent.  Thinking of these following axes an decorations on the parent axes (like legend) 
- @Eric F summary of history of axes_grid and friends
- discussion of what parts of axes_grid we can move up into the ‘mainline’ of the codebase
- @Eric F  - refactor and better document code to reduce technical debt? 
- @Eric F Cleaning up current ticker might be worth doing before we do whole-sale re-write
- @Eric F suggests that we accept more breakage of edge-case APIs for improved consistency,  
- trade off: replacing more complex with simpler 👍 , complex with complex 👎 
- @Thomas C sold on:
  - axes_inset as children of parent axes
  - more thought on axis children objects 
    - different x spine/multiple x spines 
    - facilitates hierarchical locating/labeling 
    - ticker - container for one formatter/locator
    - smarter ticker that can have sequence of :
      - spines, locators, formatters
    - thing that’s drawn: spine/tickers/formatters
    - axis: information about scale, patches, etc.
      - scale sets transform, default locator, formatter
      - blended scale - apply 
        - transform(y) to y data, 
        - transform(x) on x data
        -  separate transform for projection 
      - need full transform to do all ticks
    
  - **Wh****ere to put developer notes?**
  - add tutorial section for developers
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10947
  - Notes in progress?
    - @Antony L suggested the wiki
    - **Con****se****nsus** https://github.com/orgs/matplotlib/teams/developers
  - 
  - **Perez:** 
- possible rewrite pyplot with aim to more consistent input → output, state machine
  - 
  - **Gitwash/git workflow documentation**
- Find out who has push on it
- using it to standardize workflow across communities
- @Antony L suggesting we just link to central gitwash instead of bothering with templating
- @Tim H https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10997
  - 
  - **Mailing list:**
- @Jody K suggest automatic reply on rejected posts saying you have to join to post to the list
  - 
  - **Tool manager:**
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9022 
- @Antony L - good idea but ToolBarManager should be moved out of core
- @Thomas C can’t be moved out ‘cause too coupled with GUI backends 
- @Jody K why ToolBarManager?
  - @Thomas C makes toolbar modular -can just add buttons for things like zoom and lasso
  - @Antony L adding buttons using homebuilt widget system → tool bar manager → write full blown QT GUI
  - @Antony L wants to know if it will be the full blown default or another axis_grid
  - backends: everything except WX (which is in PR)
- goal for 3, default in 3.1

  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/5665#issuecomment-377269387
## Notes 2 Apr 2018
  - **MEP about MEP?** @Thomas C **will do book keeping tasks**
- When to write a MEP?
  - proposing controversial features, 
  - backward incompatible features
  - big new features/ major features
  - add to top of : https://matplotlib.org/devel/MEP/index.html
  - in readme.txt add link to MEP page
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/tree/master/doc/devel
- possibly update index with abstract info from MEP
- Style guide for MEPs
  - https://matplotlib.org/devel/MEP/template.html
- Where to discuss MEPS?
  - PR + DEV mailing list? 
  - numpy just had this discussion- ended up split between PR and mailing list
  - cross link wiki MEPs to PR MEPS, declare which is canonical version
  - PR to doc/devel/mep
- When proposing a MEP:
  1. do a small PR that adds your MEP to the master list (in https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/MEP/index.html),
  2. have another PR with the actual discussion.  Helps avoiding conflicting numbers.

  - **Need text/followup from** @Thomas C **on**
[x] summer student
[x] documentation summit
  
  - **Tick Refactor** @Tim H ****
- target 3.1
- MEP?
- concern about how much of the current flexibility do we actually use? 
- get buy in from cartopy and astropy/yt/wcsaxes/etc
- 3 phases to roll out (probably 2 year timeline):
  - old system as default + new as beta
  - new as default + old available
  - drop old system
- Figure out how much of the API changes/what public methods need to  dropped;
    - public api that predates __ convention
    - are ticks markers or line collections or something else?
    - gridlines are line collections/single broken line
    - @Antony L sketch: https://github.com/anntzer/matplotlib/tree/_wip/newaxis
    - how does it work with projections?
      - straight line in proj space or data space 
        - rader plots wants straight
        - other polar wants curved 
        - `l.get_path()._interpolation_steps = GRIDLINE_INTERPOLATION_STEPS` L505 in axis.py
    - how does it work with labeling?
      - correctly computing normals of the edge
    - Snapping:
      - have to snap ticks and axes border and girdlines
      - currently snap to closest pixel
  - **TextCollection? instead of list of Texts**
- text rendering may be slow because of rasterization of individual glyphs, but should be profiled
- might be good for completeness/API reasons
- @Ryan M scattertext WIP: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/4063
  - needs colormapping
- marker, patch and polycollection 
  - marker codepath/ in draw path:
    - if all markers same, draw once and stamp (draw marker path)
    - if one marker different, falls back on individual rendering (draw poly path)

[ ] DateFormatter and Locator @Jody K 
  Do we want to update the default locator and ticks or just provide another Formatter option for savvy users?

[ ] Extra Ticks: 
  why do we need extra ticks around viewlims?  These end up causing headaches because they are not drawn, and their visible state is true (in master).  
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10881
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/10874

## Notes: 26 Mar 2018
  - Antony, Hannah, Ryan, Jody
  - **Ticks**
  - issues with extra ticks outside viewlims.  Antony said they were due to roundoff errors.
  - maybe trim at Locator level. 
  - deprecate not visible:  
    - `ticker.Locator` would all need to change
    - deprecate out of range ticks first, and then expect proper list
    - epsilon out of viewlims?  Keep those.  
  - ticks and lines top and bottom: individual lines for each ticks.  
    - overhaul, single line for top and bottom ticks.  `LineCollection` for grids.
    - back compatibility?  Custom `Axes` subclass with new `Axis` subclass….
    - each line call is slow (units support).
    - speed benefit? 
    - can’t manipulate individual tick visibility.  
  - 
  - **Datetime formatting:**
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10841
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9801
  - General agreement locator
  - General agreement formatter:
    - needs way to get old beghaviour
    - useful for teaching/default
  - @Antony L suggested naming convention
    - MPLxyDateFormatter
    - Alias AutoFormatter to current MPLXYDateFormatter
    - Document “We reserve right to change formatter”
  - deprecate old linear scalar formatter? 
  - localization of month
    - Check if way?
