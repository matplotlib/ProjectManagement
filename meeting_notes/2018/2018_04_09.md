## Notes

**Inset_axes/spine tick stuff**

-  @Eric F spend time over the weekend reading through how tick code actually works and took notes.
-  @Jody K Currently we don‚Äôt have a notion of ‚Äònested‚Äô axes, but that it would make sense to have ‚Äòchild‚Äô axes that is follows the parent.  Thinking of these following axes an decorations on the parent axes (like legend)
- @Eric F summary of history of axes_grid and friends
- discussion of what parts of axes_grid we can move up into the ‚Äòmainline‚Äô of the codebase
- @Eric F  - refactor and better document code to reduce technical debt?
- @Eric F Cleaning up current ticker might be worth doing before we do whole-sale re-write
- @Eric F suggests that we accept more breakage of edge-case APIs for improved consistency,  
- trade off: replacing more complex with simpler üëç , complex with complex üëé
- @Thomas C sold on:
  - axes_inset as children of parent axes
  - more thought on axis children objects
    - different x spine/multiple x spines
    - facilitates hierarchical locating/labeling
    - ticker - container for one formatter/locator
    - smarter ticker that can have sequence of :
      - spines, locators, formatters
    - thing that‚Äôs drawn: spine/tickers/formatters
    - axis: information about scale, patches, etc.
      - scale sets transform, default locator, formatter
      - blended scale - apply
        - transform(y) to y data,
        - transform(x) on x data
        -  separate transform for projection
      - need full transform to do all ticks


**Where to put developer notes?**

  - add tutorial section for developers
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10947
  - Notes in progress?
    - @Antony L suggested the wiki
    - **Con****se****nsus** https://github.com/orgs/matplotlib/teams/developers

**Perez:**

- possible rewrite pyplot with aim to more consistent input ‚Üí output, state machine

**Gitwash/git workflow documentation**

- Find out who has push on it
- using it to standardize workflow across communities
- @Antony L suggesting we just link to central gitwash instead of bothering with templating
- @Tim H https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10997

**Mailing list:**

- @Jody K suggest automatic reply on rejected posts saying you have to join to post to the list

**Tool manager:**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9022
- @Antony L - good idea but ToolBarManager should be moved out of core
- @Thomas C can‚Äôt be moved out ‚Äòcause too coupled with GUI backends
- @Jody K why ToolBarManager?
  - @Thomas C makes toolbar modular -can just add buttons for things like zoom and lasso
  - @Antony L adding buttons using homebuilt widget system ‚Üí tool bar manager ‚Üí write full blown QT GUI
  - @Antony L wants to know if it will be the full blown default or another axis_grid
  - backends: everything except WX (which is in PR)
- goal for 3, default in 3.1
