## Notes

**releases**
@Thomas C and @P I  are having minor scheduling issues, “soon”
**12839:**

- accept the PR/override @Antony L concerns

**12856:** 

- todo:  add usetex to scalerformatter 
- needs: whats new entry
- related to larger question of how/when rcparams do their thing

**11964:**

- trust @Antony L + won’t discover edgecases until try to build wheels

**9913**

- not reproducible on mac/linux
- @Antony L cannot repro on windows+mpl3.0.3+qt5

**12716**

- can be merged? unclear what @David S intended

**11732** 

- matplotlib wheel on pypi never has test data
- matplotib-tests package would get tests
- either build from wheel - no test data, or test data from source 
- adding a rogue/hidden setup.py
- need to remove tests from default wheel

**8638**

- @Thomas C has homework to address comments



# 18 Feb 2019
## Notes
## v2.2.4 and v3.0.3 state
- just waiting for backports to finish CI

**Compass Notation for Legend Placement**

- Short & Long notion w/o spaces
  - [north, northeast, northwest,  south, southeast, southwest, west, east]
  - [N, NE, NW, S, SE, SW, W, E]
- old notation still saying

**histograms #6669**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/6669
- people want to plot histograms without recomputing histogram
  - can abuse current API to do it - 
    - pass in counts as weights & bins = bins, and bins-1 as data
  - have to pass in bins & weights 
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/6669#issuecomment-464676022
  - function that does this would be thin wrapper on hist
  - add in count kwarg and blow up if counts+weights or better doc the trick
    - pro: counts is clearer than weights ‘cause it doesn’t require understanding the trick
  - can also make x(data) optional 
    - can accidentally do something weird 
  - Sample API:
    - `ax.hist(bins=bins, weights=counts)`
      - `ax.hist(x, bins=bins, weights=counts)`  # won’t work
      - `ax.hist(x, weight=counts)` # may work depending on sizes, uses current behavior
      - con: might give users pause on ‘why are my counts weights’
      - con: documentation on weights gets a bit fussier
      - pro: no new kwargs, simple 
    - `ax.hist(counts, bins=bins, as_counts=True)`
      - `ax.hist(counts, bins=bins, as_count=some_state)`
    - `ax.hist(bins=bins, counts=counts)`
      - `ax.hist(x, bins=bins, counts=counts)` # wont work
      - `ax.hist(bins=bins, counts=counts, weights=weights)` # will raise
      - `ax.hist(x, counts=counts)` # won’t work, will raise
      - con: does not make sense with non-int ‘counts’
      - pro: bit clearer what intent is 

**closed step: 5855**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/5855
- step plot, but you want to close it
- use `where` kwarg add -auto/interlaced (in addition to pre/post)

**tick params visibility 12839**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12839
- don’t use setp for ticks, change defaults

## Notes

**Outstanding PRs** **/ work** **for 3.0.3**

- [OS/X backend + latex = event loop chokin](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/13066)[g #](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/13066)[13066](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/13066) - punted to 3.1?
- needs release note


- close with no action, corrected on wheels sides ( https://github.com/MacPython/matplotlib-wheels/pull/5)
https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12119


[matplotlib/matplotlib#12119](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12119) [](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12119)


- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13405 (needs second review)
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11246 (needs some comments addressed by @Thomas C )
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/13258 last outstanding issue 

**Scatter Legend**

- @Eric F in charge of merging it

**Set Size Inches**

- Decided to support set_size(value, value, unit=unit) / set_size(value, value, unit) / figsize=(value, value, unit)

**min/max vs left/right named arguments**

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11137


[matplotlib/matplotlib#11137](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11137)

- rectangular vs. polar 
- left/right/top/bottom already there
- decided to back out of deprecating xmin/xmax

**logging - 13275**

- how to provide feedback to users → how to turn on logging→handler for the logging
- no handlers installed by default
- talk to ipython folks about adding it to %matplotlib? 
  - switch ownership over to matplotlib?
    - deferred magic? - simplifies newer backend support

**Compass versus left- center-right, upper-center-lower vs 0-9 orientation**

- @Eric F - leave long names + short for alias
- polar only supports uppercase, so here upper case only

**Voxels shading 13123**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13123
- skip deprecation period? - already have 2 other PRs where the images are broken due to the deprecation
- there’s a shade=False flag  - 
  - default to None, require to say explicitly, set default to false + raise deprecated warning,  switch to True on next release - Numpy model?
    - decided against this, keep it simple. voxels is relatively new, few users, low impact.
  - ping @David S to release objections

**agenda cleanup**
Hannah graciously deleted 2018 notes from this doc and moved them to another document, so that this one stays tidy. [+☑️ Matplotlib 2018 meeting agenda](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Matplotlib-2018-meeting-agenda-BWqBlwtVjg9XY5ToQLvcG) 

# 4 Feb 2019
  [ ] verbose/logging method: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13275 
  [x] colorbar norm: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13234
  [x] final decision on summer students
    [x] https://gitter.im/geopandas/geopandas?at=5c584e4b9221b9382d12eeea
  [ ] NE vs upper-right discussion…
    [ ] Anchored artist legend: `upper right`
    [ ] Axes_Divider NE/NW
## Notes
- @Thomas C sent out email about release schedule 

**Colorbar Norm #13234**

- undoing @Eric F design choice:
    - original inheritance from scalarmappable,  when colorbar is really dependent on the AxesImage/Scatter - change the mappable rather than colorbar
  - @Jody K made mock scalarmappable that can be deprecated

**Units issue discussion #13236**

- what does default width mean in context of units? 
  - bar is set to .8 width relative to ? (but what when data is united)
  - datetime w/ timedelta
  - xref:https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12903
  - [+☑️ Matplotlib 2019 meeting agenda: unit-conversion:](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Matplotlib-2019-meeting-agenda-unit-conversion-aAmENlkgepgsMeDZtlsYu#:uid=393380968722540654338756&amp;h2=unit-conversion:) 

**Summer Students**

- summer joint project between geopandas + pysal (pysal will kick in mentors)
  - emailed NF to ask if they are ok with mentors from non-NF projects
- students propose their own projects
- due to lack of available effort, lets run through GSoC this year
- @hannah a will take lead on admin side

**Wh****at do do with** **John Hunter Fellowship money?**

- https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/03/john-hunter-fellowship-2014.html
- look into doing it this way again this year

**Legend location** 

- geographic coordinates - [N, S, etc]
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13072
- upper right is ambiguous ‘cause besides or on top of bunch of axis
- need centralized documentation of how it *should* be done, then can move towards doing it uniformly.
- conflicts with change from min/max to {top, bottom}, {left, right}
  - this older change also conflicts badly with polar
- think of these as layered APIs?
- 

**OS/X Backend**

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12918

- [matplotlib/matplotlib#12918](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12918)
- [matplotlib/matplotlib#1](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12918)3096
- OS/X backend used to be verified using cocoa app - @Jody K 
- on master, milestoned as bugfix though

**Backport/to do/bugfix/critical**

- sphinx related fixes to 2.2??
- vendored old version of jequery - pull request that downloads it as part of install process 11246
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11246
  - can build on boat (except first time, that time needs internet)
  - put in .cache, check there on reinstall (survive git clean -xfd)
- closed: (retina dpi bug) https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/10160
- need to prioritize next two weeks worth of bugfixes 
  - start moving things to new milestones
  - things that should go in - release critical
  - things that can be punted - label w/ next milestone
