- ~~JOSS reviewing~~
- ~~Job posts on social media + mailing lists~~
# 24 Dec, 31 Dec 
- no meeting/on vacation
# 17 Dec
## Agenda
- New gallery example policy ← is goal to decrease these?
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15914
- feature merge guidelines
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15898
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15602
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/atplotlib/pull/15771
- twitter discussion over the weekend
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15961
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/15960
- PRs that need quick attention to merge
- can NF fund an OSX machine (and maybe windows machine?) for all core devs? 
## Notes

**15961: opinionated env environment**

- recommend that people use an environment that isolates things
- someone needs to write conda w/ env instructions - @Eric F

**NF funding dev servers/machines**

- @hannah/@thomas will ask on this week’s project call 
    - with remote VNC login (aka remote desktop)
- can also maybe buy a machine 
- option to rent [https://www.macminicolo.net/pricing.html](https://www.macminicolo.net/pricing.html)

**twitter**

- it’s twitter

**Adding new gallery examples**

- cost tradeoffs of accepting PRs from new contributors & maintaince burden
- some projects have “official” vs “user” examples
    - aim was to do this with the discourse/blog
- sort in to two levels of “common” vs “specialized”
    - 80% of people can find the thing they want in 10% of the gallery
    - in-kind donations of UX designer time to sort out docs/gallery
- conflict between simple examples that show one thing vs very nice plots that show many things
    - @hannah a wants to run a sprint for a “chart types” sub-gallery 
        - simple examples one thing with clear data structure assumptions laid out
    - maybe split up gallery further? ← this is a conversation with the UX person?
- look into running pngcrush on files

**Adding new features**

- reasonable judgement standard?
    - cost/benefit  analysis
    - what would people expect from this feature? 
        - reasonable extensibility
        - don’t box your self into a corner
        - clear signaling that API is provisional and subject to change?
    - difference between things that make a lot of internal changes vs things that are mostly bolted onto the outside
- features that can be 3rd party extensions vs. need to change codebase
    - how coupled the functionality is to our internal state, how likely are to need coupled releases
- everyone is +0.2 but no one wants to push the button and/or put in the effort to do a through review 
    - assign champion?
        - one dev who thinks it can get it passed in a phone call/discussion/merged 
            - ensure big picture sign off before requesting a ton of work
    - should make sure we do a high-level “is this a good idea” review *before* we do fine-grained code review

**Actionable: new features + new gallery**

- Modify Review Guidelines + send out email to dev list
    - High level sign off before find-grained code review
    - assign a named liaison to help push the PR through
    - Draft PRs should be used for situations where code feedback might help with deciding high level
# 10 Dec
## Agenda
- Governance/Guidelines - short discussion/please review before meeting
    - [+Communication Guidelines](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Communication-Guidelines-GMgkvuznnxwtZpwFvPogS) 
    - [+Contributor Roadmap/Expectations](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Contributor-RoadmapExpectations-2bL0g3R5qUhSExAasfaMY) 
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15903
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15898I
## Notes

**Governance/Guidelines**

- governance docs should move to docs/docs at some point
    - governance/guidelines should be in same place as governance docs
    - start by putting PRs into governance repository with: @hannah a 
        - the roadmap
        - social guideline
        - named roles
- Roadmap
    - decoupling admin from streering council
    - clarify administrative & advisory roles
        - named roles & responsibility
        - restructure github teams
            - rename github team admins
    - named roles
        - ID jobs already being done
        - fixed terms
        - sort out {voting / appointment / volunteer as tribute} later
        

**1****5903****: handle non-affine transData in Collection.get_datalim**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15903/files
- Defer pulling out the affine part of the transfrom so we can check later if tranData is in the transfrom.  This could fail before if transData is non-affine (ex log or geographic)

**15763****: skip webagg test if no tornado**

- skip tests if missing tornado
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15763

**15898: textcolor kwarg for legend**

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15898

- [matplotlib/matplotlib#15898](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15898)
- single kwarg for matching elements & colors so don’t have to worry about priority conflicts
- needs to support all variants of colors mpl allows, in len=1, and len=(handles)
- does it support patch objects?
- Artist provides some of this with the legend handle & labels
    - artist stores some of this information
    - some negotion between artists and legends
    - api homogenization so basically same methods
-  More sophisticated API would be something like
    - legend(…, textcolor={Line2D: “markerfacecolor”, Patch: “edgecolor”})
    - possibly also allowing overriding for specific artists ({artist: …})
    - this is consistent with the legend handler_map API

        - audience is maybe people who use matplotlib as an interface
        - maybe based on ggplot/pandas cheatsheets
            - https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf
            - https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf

     `plt.xticks(labels=['a', 'b'])` fails with a cryptic message, what do want:
    - allow just passing labels?
    - better error message
- Should default values docs be allowed to be semantic instead of strictly stating the value?

## Notes

**RSEF job posting**

- close out Jan 3
- advertising:
    - all the core mailing lists
        [x] (numpy, 
        [x] scipy, 
        [ ] pandas, 
        [ ] sklearn, 
        [x] xarray, 
        [x] skimage, 
        [x] our mailing lists
        [x] h5py
        [x] python.org job board 
    - reach out to Bio land
    - post to our front page @Thomas C 

**communication guidelines / contributor exp****ec****tations**

- guidelines are how to represent Matplotlib in the public space
- contributor expectations : how to get permissions / process for joining the team!
    - governance
- CoC
    - we need to have one, but have choice of what it will be
    - still have to work through some of the international cultural differences within the project
- Most of this content should move to governance docs eventually

**Admin stuff in call**

- SIG for discussing admin stuff
    - nah
- Send out to executive comittee & email around soliciting feedback, limit call to short discussion

**NF small grant**

- have 5k in hand
- ggplot is one consistent interface 
    - mpl has multiple interfaces
    - multiple cheatsheets, one for each interface
        - condensed version of gallery 
- task oriented cheat-sheet?
    - I want to do “XYZ”
- how do color maps and norms work together
- two stage process
    - one stage is sorting out content
    - second stage is laying out (spend money here?)
- reach out to Software Carpentry for the sticking points we need to clean up
- Reach out to Ernest, Nicholas Rougier, Joe Kington, Ben Root
- use this as a model for how people should teach mpl
- https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-cheatsheet

**15806: 3.2 breaks cartopy**

- @Jody K will look at it

**backporting to 3.2.1?**

- anything that could be backported to 3.2.1 can be backported to 3.2.0
- the 3.2.1 milestone triggers backports → v3.2.x branch that will eventually be release as 3.2.0, at this point we don’t really have a 3.2.1 target, just a 3.2.0 target, but keeping them separate at the milestone level is useful for tracking what is critical and what is not.

**“semantic values” for defaults**

- add units if the default value is a unit of something (like bar width)
- add note to documentation guide about how to interpret default values in the written docs, should not just restate signature

**15788: plt.xticks(None, labels=[])**

- not allow labels via pyplot interface 
- better error message

    - joint w/pyviz: https://github.com/pyviz/contrib_colormaps
## Notes:

**close out project boards:**

    - Polar Overhaul - ask Eliot if he’s using the board
    - Docs - the top level task here is done
    - axes_grid - leaving it for @Jody K 
    - catagorical leave to @hannah a ‘s discretion

**jet brains tools license**

    - if you are a regular contributor and want a license, let @Thomas C know by end of Nov

**color manipulation tools**

    - have a open PR for adding lighten / darken functions https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15596
    - Pro:
        - these are useful tools for generating related colors on the fly
        - could have a Color class for manipulations
        - if we want to pick up a dependency, we want to make sure it is stable so we don’t end up owning that too
        - small functions are easy to maintain
        - can deprecate in future if we want
    - cons:
        - out of scope
    - should check what other color manipulations we have
        - maybe mplot3D for shadding?
        - hill shading
    - if we add should match css standards
    - find a color expert to consult
    - **leaning towards including because**
        - maintenance burden is not large
        - has good use case story

**contributed color maps**

- https://github.com/pyviz/contrib_colormaps
- tests need fixing up
- needs tags

**hackathon / sprint**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15594/files
    - looks good, just a few minor typo/naming issues
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15595
    - looks good, needs an example
    - either in PR or follow up PR to add 
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15591
    - remove the FAQ entry for now

# 22 Oct
## notes

**3.2/2.2.5/3.1.2**

- lots of progress made, no tags yet
- @Thomas C still needs to do something about webagg
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/14298
    - pushed to 3.3, looks like a real bug, but we don’t think a regression and no one has looked at it carefully yet.
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14501
    - merged, @Thomas C will fix up doc build in follow up if required
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/14524
    - won’t ifx, py2 only, missing the python API we need to fix it
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/13619
    - @Antony L has already fixed this
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/14169
    - @Thomas C will look at
- moved rest to 3.2.1
- Discussed https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/5800 and the question of whether draw_idle should be a no-op for non-interactive backends.  The consensus seems to be leaning in that direction.


# 15 Oct
## Agenda 
- v3.2.0rc1 cut
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15065
- 3.1.2, 2.2.5?
## Notes 
- 3.2.0
    - email cristoph and turn crank on multi-build
- 3.1.2 and 2.2.5 this week by @Thomas C 
    - no rcs, just do the release
- discussion of pillow wheels for pre-release on windows
    - just wait for them to have py38 wheels official available
    - consider the self-mirroring of gohlke wheels if needed in the future
- looked at PR 15065
    - big chunk of work that needs to be carefully reviewed
    - considering nominating a champion to shepard through process, asked them if they are willing privately.
- 2.2.5 work
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14582
        - merged, will clean up docs en-mass later
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15208
        - merged
        - but has terrible typo also in oginiral PR, @Thomas C will clean up
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14501
        - restarted CI, is breaking in wieird way
        - high priority to get this fixed
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14863
        - merging despite CI failures as this is a change to the JS that we do not test
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14788
- 3.1.2 work
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/14903
        - should be a blocker
        - webagg is ID as an “interactive” backend
        - we have an rc called “backend_fallback”
        - with no DISPLAY we think that the running event loop is “headless”
        - conclude we can not use the user requested backend, default to fallback
        - land on Agg
        - solution is to remove webagg from interactive_bk list and move to non-interacitve bk
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/15139
        - move to 3.2.1
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/15142
        - now have API mis-match between `ax.annotate` and `plt.annotate`
        - pushed to 3.3
# 8 Oct
## Agenda 
- https://discourse.matplotlib.org/
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14421
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15330
## Notes

**Discourse -**

    - push more conversations to discourse ‘cause content seeds content
    - also it’s searchable/discoverable docs

**15300: inifinite axline**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15330
- implemented such that transform makes it straight line in plotting coordinates
- add to axhline and axvline example: 
    - https://matplotlib.org/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/vline_hline_demo.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-vline-hline-demo-py

**15270: propogate callback exceptions when no GUI event loop**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15270
- exceptions suppressed to keep (PyQt5) GUI from aborting
- inhibits writing callback tests

**follow up on potential NYC sprint? (Is this still happening?)**

- cc @Thomas C @Ryan M 

**14421: Gridspec as first class citizen**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14421
- tension on documentation/confusion on what becomes the entry point
    - plt.subplots(grid=gs) creates priority problem with nrows, ncols, grid
    - inherited matlab API + shiny new all the customizations stuff = API confusion/unclear tree
        - unless you position axis in absolute units, axis is [m, n] axis of a m,n sized grid 
        - plt.subplots() → creates 1 [nrows, ncols] gridspec object 
        - fundemental incompatibility:
            - gridspec: positions in (10,10) grid
            -  add_subplot makes 10 gridspecs because it doesn’t know if axes will use compatible geometries
- Has parent?
    - subplot always has a parent figure
    - Gridspec doesn’t need to have a parent (figure) because it can just be a pure layout engine← can be reusable 
        - can use fig.add_gridspec() to create a gridspec with a parent attached
        - gs.subplots() → now generate a subplot grid off this layout/spec
            - axes = gs.subplots() (grid of axes)
            - must create gridspec with explicit parent 
                - has no notion of current figure because doesn’t live in pyplot
                - @Antony L - functions outside of pyplot shouldn’t invoke notion of current figure
                - preferred:
                    - gs.with_parent().subplots()→ creates copy of spec with new parent+subplots
                    - needs to be heavily doc’d 
- layout:
    - ax at specific position in figure (physical) coordinates (constrained/tight doesn’t know about)
    - ax in grid location  (constrained/tight know about these)
- https://matplotlib.org/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/gridspec_nested.html#sphx-glr-gallery-subplots-axes-and-figures-gridspec-nested-py
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/1 
- **takeaway**: factoring out subplots to something that can be used independently
    - can pull out gridspec_kw, which _kw suggests should really be using an intermediate example
    - method chaining vs. all the kwarg args:
    ax0, ax1 = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8)).add_gridspec(2, 1, height_ratios=[1, 3]).subplots()


    fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(2, 1, gridspec_kw={'height_ratios': [1, 3]},figsize=(10, 8))
# 1 Oct
## Agenda
- 3.2? 3.1.2?
- PRs:
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14421 `GridSpec.subplots` convenience function/ “Should gridspecs be virtual or actual”

## Agenda


- 3.2 update?
    - tagged?   RC?
- mplcairo 0.2 is out:
    - what are prospects for bringing it to main library (seems to have fewer annoyances than Agg, still actively supported, unlike Agg)?
- Discourse: https://discourse.matplotlib.org  ?? 
    - Is this going to be activated and organized?
- PRs:
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15333 (add “fair” kwarg to `DivergingNorm`)?

- Label <sprint> for sprint suitable issues
    - has anybody followed up/which sprint? 
## Notes

**3.2 state**

- need to check with @P I 

**mplcairo**

- pybind as dependency (scipy has it as build time)
- still waiting to see how scipy does

**pillow vs our own png**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15193
- can’t handle 16-bit pngs
- similar speeds
- new runtime dependency (versus png build time)
- easier build process windows
- seems actively maintained

**discourse**

- need copy
- need to publicize + add link to readme 
- check with bokeh about borrowing their text

**PRs**

- DivirgingNorm:  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15333
    - put center argument in regular Norm?
        - @Thomas C can’t put a center in Norm or it’ll be overconstrained? 
        - or make center + vmin required
    - should be renamed to PieceWiseLineaer? because misleading
    - solutions: 
        - should be its own Norm 
        - Make the API proposed in  work - set limits on colorbar axes
            -  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/13948
        - set min_clip, max_clip  for the colorbar 
        - make norm that doesn’t have to map to 0-1
        - three things:
            - norm: maps data [0, 1]
            - colormap: maps {-1, 1.1, nan} + [0, 1] → RBGA
            - color bar: shows mapping between data ↔ RGBA
        - allowing the limits of the colorbar limits to changes means that we will have colors in the image not in the color bar
        - there are concerns about a norm that maps data to a more restricted range that [0, 1] (how does the over/under work?)
            - how does this connect to the ‘extend’ arrows on the color bar
        - Could also express this as manipulating color maps
            - but the user API on that is not great
    - This is in general a good idea (how to map into only *part* of the color map, but need more thought to 
    - maybe a bunch of factories that return a norm and a colormap?
        - devil is in the details!
    - maybe give colormaps a way to adjust the value it decides over/under is at?
- town crier https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15158 
    - we should do it!
        
            
    
# 18 September
## Agenda
- Sphinx math: https://www.sympy.org/sphinx-math-dollar/
## Notes

**Sphinx Math** 

    - how does it compare with https://github.com/matthew-brett/texext ?
    - discussion about replacing `:math:'gamma``'` with 𝛾 or `\N{GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA}`
        - decided against the above, @Eric F is very concerned about unicode in docstrings
    - resolution: compare texext to sphinx-math-dollar, no unicode in docstrings

**15247: Colorbar tick placement** 

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/15247
-  fix can go into 3.2
- discussion about what parts of axes_grid should be pulled out
    - allows setting spacing in physical units
    - builds from the inside out, rather than the outside in
    - the logic for placement should not affect the types you get back

**14668, 15091: colormaps**

- Rainforest: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/14668
- turbo https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/15091
- suggest that packaging as standalone colormaps 
- wait on user demand or published papers?
- creating an umbrella package for user contributed colormaps? 
    - modeled on https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
    - more generalized version of: https://github.com/matplotlib/cmocean
    - something like a less curated/user contributed: https://github.com/pyviz/colorcet
    - @Thomas C will reach out to colorcet about collaborating on this library
- decison:
    - merge turbo
    - make rainforest the first colormap in a inaugural 

1**5127: cmap registration**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15127
- people can publish modules without registering
- registration allows cmaps to be used as cmap=’mycolormap’ (by name) rather than cm.mycolormap or plt.get_cmap(‘mycolormap’) or customlib.cmap

# 03 September
## Agenda
- website re-design
- blog launch
- discourse launch
- 3.2 / 3.1.2 / 2.2.5 triage wrap up / review
## Notes

@Ryan M @Thomas C @Eric F @Antony L @Dora C @hannah a @Jody K 

**website redesign**

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15146


[matplotlib/matplotlib#15146](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15146)
****

- Good goal, but can be challanging to do this work without understanding why
- what are the goals for the Matplotlib website
    - who does it speak to, what are their needs
        - new users
        - experienced users
        - new contributors
        - potential funders
        - overlap: [+In☑️ Matplotlib 2019 meeting agenda: Documentation-summit-planning](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/In-Matplotlib-2019-meeting-agenda-Documentation-summit-planning-aAmENlkgepgsMeDZtlsYu#:uid=163306418864971294891302&amp;h2=Documentation-summit-planning) 
- sort out who should be in the conversation
    - set up sub-committee to handle website
    - 
    - @Tim H (?) @David S (?) @Thomas C @Dora C @hannah a @Eric F 
    - make sure work-product is open
    - optimum number of people: 3-6 is probably manageable, less than 10
    - make sure we get people from diverse stake holders
- need these documentation to help decide what content should be where on the website.
- go through analytics:
    - usage patterns/stories

**blog and discourse launch**

- Launch discourse on Thursday
- @Thomas C  and @hannah a will seed initial topics
    - [https://discourse.matplotlib.org](https://discourse.matplotlib.org/)
    - sections:  announce, users, dev, contribute, showcase, install
- need to follow up with Davide about Blog
    - https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/
    - sections: tutorial, showcase, 3rd party package

**What’s new + API changes** 

    - like editing a 20 page paper (dry block of text)
    - what’s new is a press release
    - needs manual editing/grouping
    - @Eric F : split out  into seperate manual highlights 
        - just concatenate whats new as it falls
        - extract a “high-lights” page 
    - @Jody K : write the API changes into categories + file for each category:
        - deprecations
        - key word changes
        - removals
        - behavior changes
    - Automating?
        - @Matthias B has a script that can maybe autofind API changes
        - @Antony L might write a script to autofind deprecation changes
        

**Close out PRs**

    
- [matplotlib/matplotlib#15168](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15168)
    - premptive bugfix & leave this to numpy/cpython to sort out w/ potential fallback on mpl code
- merged https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13702
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11947
    - @Jody K create smaller/unambigious test case that index is all lined up
    - @Antony L plot vector field on top of stream plot
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14889 
    - Still need to investigate tiny error in image comparison; in theory the correct values should be computable by hand. Perhaps a normalization problem?
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14998
    - user: spine at position (x=0.5) in data coordinates, then need to translate it into screen coordinates (one orientation is transdata, other is translate by amount and then transdata)
    - linear spine should check transform but can’t ‘cause unknown at call, instead fills in reasonable value
    - amount - position in axis coordinates (left, right, etc), or in inches offset

    - This is a verison of https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14623 which is already on 3.1.x
    - approved modulo rebase and CI passing
    - rebase is due to some of the same changes being merged up from v1.3.x

# 12 August
## Agenda
- Discourse?  (will someone add topics?) 
    - gitter is becoming quite cluttered.  Maybe split users/dev? 
    -  Or do most devs just discuss via GitHub?
    - https://discourse.matplotlib.org
- Datetime epoch discussion?  
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15008
    - Notes at https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/15018 
- Matplotlibrc/rcsetup.py deduplication
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15029
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14929
- Push on 3.2.0
## Notes

**Upmerge 3.1.x into master**

- versioneer should work

**discourse**

- looks better!
- giving mod team about a week to curate/create topics and clean things up
- think about splitting dev vs user gitter rooms
    - re-address when discourse has had time to work it’s way through
-  @eliasNema suggested mozilla model for discourse new contributor guide:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Introduction


**instagram**

    - https://www.instagram.com/matplotart/?hl=en

**rcParam/rcsetup disambig**

- don’t keep defaults two places
- either read bare matplotlibrc 
- difference between rc and style paths:
    - style ban specific entries
    - style is additive, rcparams always start from the defaults
- discussion of moving away from custom text files → python imports
    - shipping a normal package that sources a dictionary
- @Thomas C prefers 15029 over 14929
- discussion about adding a helper to install a “stock” maplotlibrc
    - having commented version in code is good so we can just copy it out
    - but if some one edits that file everything breaks

**datetime epoch**

- there are deep issues with our current datetime handling
    - float from Jan 1, 0001 is not great
    - numpy datetime64 has some properties, but has issues with usability
    - @Eric F and @Jody K are excited about working with numpy to make this better!
- 

**push on 3.2.0 issues**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14919
- nitpicky…
    - no line numbers in the nitpick report so they don’t go stale
- “optional” for kwargs in docs? https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14862
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13397
- ran though a couple of PRs, left comments inline


# 5 August
- triage/onboarding things to adopt?
    - issue templates 
        - https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates
        - categories:
            - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#issue-tracker-tags
            - wishlist, bugfix, needs docs, I don’t know
    - circle ci live rendering 
        -  https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/tips.html#viewing-the-rendered-html-documentation-for-a-pull-request
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/53f76d1a24ef42eb8c620fc1116c53db11dd07d9/build_tools/circle/build_doc.sh#L168-L178
- add people to  matplotlib org queue/process
- Matplotlib 3.2
## Notes

**table code evolution**

- should be soft deprecated?
- currently a (new) third-party package:
    - [https://github.com/swfiua/blume](https://github.com/swfiua/blume)
- cookie cutter: https://github.com/NSLS-II/scientific-python-cookiecutter

**Triage / onboarding thing to adopt**

- make differentiated issues templates are a good idea!
- use sklearn’s categories of issues as a base:
| Bug / Crash:           | Something is happening that clearly shouldn’t happen. Wrong results as well as unexpected errors from estimators go here. |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cleanup / Enhancement: | Improving performance, usability, consistency.                                                                            |
| Documentation:         | Missing, incorrect or sub-standard documentations and examples.                                                           |
| New Feature:           | Feature requests and pull requests implementing a new feature.                                                            |

**CircleCI ‘show changes’ button**

- Requires custom browser userscript (javascript) to show button. Section in `build_docs.sh` handles “these files may have changed”.

**add users to matplotlib GH org queue**

- some process for adding people to org?
- currently @Thomas C @Ryan M @Eric F @Michael D can add people
- stick with emailing (May, Caswell, Firing) when want to add people

**discourse**

- incubation, no public sign ups yet!
- https://discourse.matplotlib.org/
- if you want in *now* email @Thomas C or @hannah a 
- needs to be reskinned

**Matplotlib 3.2**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14979
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14915
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14702
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10691
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9111 → punt
# 29 July
- matplotlib blog
    - medium-long tutorials & posts about matplotlib’s uses in different domains + 3rd party packages
    - public facing/user contributed
        - medium or gituhub.io w/ PR as user submission? 
    - stuff people want docs for that doesn’t really fit in docs
    - https://planet.scipy.org/
- monthly community calls in the fall?
- do we want a discourse community? Chris Holdgraf says they're very discoverable + we could have domain specific sections
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14512 good to go?
## Notes

**discussion about making a matplotlib blog**

- @hannah a reached out on twitter for new contirbutors, got 40-50 responses
- @eliasNema is on the call
- @Davide V is interesting in managing blog
- seems like a good thing to try!
- user-contributed snapshots of what they are doing, may bit rot.
- planet.matplotlib.org re-direct?
- defer detailed discussion until we can talk with Davide

**discourse**

- https://discourse.jupyter.org/
- “modern” version of mailing list / phpbb
- they host for 100/mo
- bokeh reports they self-host on heroku for 10/mo
- discourse.matplotlib.org
- facility user-user communication
- provide levels of moderation for admin
- https://discuss.python.org/ is python discoure for cpython
- can filter by domain
- seems like it is worth trying
- get off the ground email Stephany and Elias (cc @Thomas C)

**what problems are we trying to solve?**

- blog is trying to solve problem of showing how Matplotlib is used
    - can collect user examples that we do not want to put in the docs
    - serves as brochure site
- for discourse we want to solve problem of where to run user-user support
    - gitter isn’t great for this
    - SO has it’s issues
    - support via twitter via @hannah a is not sustainable
    - have a system for people to get credit for doing user-user support
    - aid with discoverability of conversations

**community calls**

- shelve for now

**going through PRs**

- merged 14512
- looked at https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14912/
- looked at https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14879

# 22 July
## Agenda
[ ] Github Metrics - what analysis do you want?
    [ ] https://www.dropbox.com/sh/85578qi8rfmc6t1/AAAc0pLkaPs2rEq6miEDCXpha?dl=0
[ ] Matplotlib 3.2 freeze dates


## Notes

**Git hub metrics**

- @Antony L has 70 open PRs!
- Net issues and PR per month
- time to close (excluding meeseeksbot)

**Other places to put “wish list” items**
Having an external location (not an issue)

- put on wiki?
- play with GH project boards?
- separate GH repo just to hold the issues?
- how to keep this discover-able?

**Stalled PRs** 

- tend to spiral in to disagreements
- no one wants to bite the bullet and close the PR someone put a lot of work into
- some things are deep in the weeds, not many people feel comfortable to sign off on
- go to implicit approval model for old PRs)
    - [+In☑️ Matplotlib 2019 meeting agenda: Merging](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/In-Matplotlib-2019-meeting-agenda-Merging-aAmENlkgepgsMeDZtlsYu#:h2=Merging) 
    - @Thomas C has been convinced this time around
    - @Antony L will write up PR [done]
    - on PRs with 1 review can ping / email dev list notifying of intention to merge with less than 2 reviews
- some have PRs get 1 review, but are stalled waiting for a second
- ~~differentiate between PRs from know contributors vs PRs from new peoples~~

**Github templates**
GH now lets you have different templates for bug reports vs feature requests

**Labels**
if we had better labels it would make it easier to discover 

**Matplotlib 3.2**

- need to branch and feature freeze in the next week or so
- the anti-alias PR should go in  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13724
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14512
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13077
- @P I will release manage
- @Thomas C will send out email announcing this, create new milestone, ask people to start migrating things away from 3.2 or marking as release critical
- branch first week of August
- RC1 beginning of 3rd week of August
- 3.2.0 Sept 4

**mpl docker**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-docker
- motivated because you need latex + graphviz and system and freetype is always obnouxis 

**freetype hacking**
@Antony L has a scheme of pre-loading the right version of freetype when running the tests so that the loader does not try to find freetype and hence defers the decision about what version to use until as late as possible.  [now at https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14874]

- @Thomas C : this seems sketchy, but maybe is OK?

**CZI writing**
Slowly making progress https://github.com/tacaswell/CZI_2019-07_mpl

- https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visualizing-marker-genes.html
- need to make sure our bio examples are correct, change structured data example from climate → bio
- Survey of 3rd party bio and other life science packages


**having issues getting clean environments set up**
conda + conda forge + GUI going sideways

- Tk is semi functional
- Qt not so much 
- is there more we can do for interactive testing
    - we do have some of this
    - Qt has full on testing framework

## Notes
## Scipy
- Thomas, Hannah, Ryan, Paul Ivanov

**Birds of Feather session: panel mostly of vis folks**

- Notes linked above.
- 3-D plotting future?  Not discussed, but something for us to discuss…
    - moving to GPUs?
    - grow a full 3D renderer in python
    - fix the transformstack in mplot3D
    - yt does the math on their side, and gives mpl nice-sized reduced data

**Pangeo BoF**
**Funding BoF (** @hannah a **)**

- different ways to get money
    - apply to orgs, corps should pay for everything
- DOE funding officer / program manager there (!)
    - Will Spotz
- maintenance vs shiny how to get budget
## Auto Triage Rights

**pros**

- get people more involved
- enable them to label their own PRs and Issues

c**ons**

- minor chance of abuse, but deal with that if/when it happens

**to do:** 

[ ] consilidate, tree , and group color labels
[ ] bulk offer recent contributors these right
[ ] write email to dev list announcing this
[ ] put note in docs
## 14512: Logit Locator/Formatter
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14512
- needs second reviewer (@Thomas C)
## Towncrier:
- good idea, automates away the pain of accumulating docs for the release
- run town crier on circleCI to make rendered docs show changes


## CZI

[+CZI](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/CZI-NMUblZDFOsSGB8woQFQUj) 

- due end of month (31 July)
- 50 % TAC time, SWE, grad student
- issues, PRs, full time people lead to dropping PRs and issues
- architecture and plan v4.   Needs full time thinking
    - discussed architecture at scipy with folks
- concerns about goal numbers

**Request for comment (section B)**

    - abstract
    - purpose (1 sentence)

**Architecture discussion**

    - not kept up w/ data structures “revolution”
    - data container, not rewriting: query data object at draw time.  
        - upsampling and downsampling at draw time?
        - database query? live upload
        - units and data typing could be simplified.  
        - could support streaming/distributed data
    - rewrite artists to talk to these things instead of numpy arrays   
        - hierarchical artists & semantic artists
        - would do styling & translating to visual (no data manipulation)
    - Re-arrange API so that `axes` doesn’t contain all the artist-adding methods.
        - multi-axes artists. i.e.  parasite histograms; one handle.
    - How to organize:
        - new repo? prototypes at least….
        - CZI is just one year, so would need more funding….
        - new namespace to import from, and then back-fill into base namespace.
        - How to do back-compat will be an issue.  
    - downstream planning needed.
    - Chance to clean a lot of API things up 
        - aim for consistency and discoverability
        - use subclassing to get old API?
            - de-emphasize and de-dcoument, stop extending…
    - Draw/export
    - Lower level abstraction:
        - to 3-D we do all math python side→renderer
        - scene graph push into 3-D rendering pipeline.
        - need to do three-d fundamentally .  
            - vector formats straight forward of 2-D
            - 3-D fundamentally rasterized (?)
            - there are algorithms to split lines / planes into sections “in the classical times” , may be possible to still support vector output
    - include something about animation
    - overhauling picking / events
        - look at JS apis
    - start to collect use-case examples that need to stay possible
## Matplotlib testing/docs docker image
- docker image w/ working tests/docs (@Maksim R has tentatively volunteered to work on this)

**pybind 11**

- re-address in 6months after scipy has some experience with this
# 8 July
## Notes

@Antony L and @Eric F discussed several PRs and issues:

- 13397 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13397 Deprecate axisgrid1 colorbar
- 14705 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14705/ Fix obscure text glitch
- 13567 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13567 Deprecate MovieWriterRegistry cache-dirtyness system.
- 14463 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14463 We are looking at whether, and if so how, to unify twin axes with secondary axes, since they are closely related.  The thought is to modify the latter so that they would be separate axes (like twins) rather than children, and would include plotting methods.  All this is food for thought and discussion, not a settled matter.
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/13819, 8878, 4900 all relate to aspect-ratio handling.  The thought is to simplify it by generalizing Axes.get_data_ratio so that it uses the axis transforms to calculate a ratio.  (See https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/4900#issuecomment-415405446 for example code.) Get_data_ratio_log would then be identical to get_data_ratio.  Axes subclasses that override get_data_ratio would be unaffected.  If warranted, the common linear-linear case could be special-cased as an optimization.

    - questions if documentation is the best topic of a summit
    - @Eric F suggests we settle outstanding architecture changes before investing heavily in documentation

**issues with development**

- have trouble making major architecture decisions / changes
- have large number of open issues / PRs
- trailing other projects in term of professionalization

        - tasks
            - governance hardening 
                - PSF code of conduct 
            - issue/pull request burn down
            - big architectural issues / mpl 4
                - matpotlib more of a base for everything else
                - software tooling required for that
                - integration with pandas / sklearn / xarray
# 24 June
- ownership of matplotlib meeting 
- changing the meeting time the Fall semester
- Numfocus small dev grant call open - use money for  doc summit?  (Can only put in one per org)
- Doc summit 
- https://www.pullrequest.com/googleserve/?
## notes

**T****ype hints**

- concerns:
    - would they be solving a high-priority problem?
        - maybe not
    - add to our learning curve of new contributors
- they have uses, but our input / output types are pretty complex
- need to wait for numpy to sort them selves out first
- we do not want to be the leading edge of this in the community

**ownership of call**

- not sorted out, but call worked ok

**meeting time change for fall**

- send out doodle poll to mailing list
- options are:
    - hour earlier
    - shift to same time, different day

**small grants**

- doc summit funding
- cheat-sheets

**doc summit**

- tbd

**mpl 3.1.1** 

- paul is working on it 
# 17 June
- https://www.pullrequest.com/googleserve/
- Type hints? https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14278
## Notes

**No 3.8 syntax before 2021 (dropping 3.7 then)**
**14278: Type annotations (**https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)

- ask for removal of type annotations ‘cause need to set standards first
- does the coding guide need a note on type annotations? 
| Pros                                                                                     | Cons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**Small Dev Grant**

- Use it to fund peacemeal doc/design work like cheetsheets? 

**Pull request** (https://www.pullrequest.com/googleserve/)

    - We missed the window and this is not really aimed at us, more at orgs that own significant software but are not software shops (ex a client focused non-profit)
- discussed June 10 
- probably can’t provided type of review mpl needs
    - provide way to move huge unweildy library w/o alienating stakeholders
    - smart things to say about evolving an API


# 10 June 

@Thomas C @P I @Eric F 

## Agenda
- 3.1.1
- quansight webinar
## notes

**what are we waiting on** **(3.1.1)****?**

- [matplotlib/matplotlib#14339](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/14339)
    - intended behavior
- backported segfault
- re-milestoned everything else

**4** **road map?**

- better support for structured data
    - pandas, xarray, 
    - three kinds of data structures
        - what the user starts with (pandas, xarrays, lists, dicts, networkx, … )
        - how we store stuff internally (at a high level)
        - at some point we need scaler / array / masked arrays
    - critical to keep the top two levels independent
    - looks like a pandora’s box!
    - provide a way to “wrap” your data structure to something we can work with
        - aka the middle level
        - example of desired use-case: artist that wraps a database query
- better support for extension libraries
    - still working on *how* to solve it
- better support for complex layouts
    - compound plots
        - color bar
        - scatter + parasite histograms
    - constrained layout
    - better handling linked data
- inter-op with other plotting tools
- not matpltolib 4, but matplotlib core.
- tension between being a user interface, and a library
    - when do you infer nicities versus blow up loudly
    - pyplot is one possible user interface that we have now
    - we want other possibilities

**Backend stuff:**

| agg       | **Functionality baked into code outside of regular backend pipeline** <br>(**why agg is a dependency)**<br><br>- image resampling (convolution filters-could maybe use numpy to do it) <br>- path handling (is point in curve, computational geometry)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Numfocus NASA grant: $5-10K outsourced to Numfocus contractor

**Optimize AxisImage**
Displaying 2D data is one of the core functionalities of Matplotlib that is used across NASA.  To display a 2D image Matplotlib takes the user array, normalizes it to the range [0, 1] (possibly in a non-linear way), re-samples the data to resolution required for display, and then color maps to RGBA.  For large images this process can become computationally intensive to the point where the latency makes interactive use frustrating to impossible.  This code has not recently been optimized, bench marked, or profiled.  It is likely that we can significantly improve the draw time by optimizing the code, effectively caching intermediate results, and making better use of what we know to avoid unneeded computation.  It is also likely that some of the time consuming computations are amenable for parallel processing.

This work will take 2-8 weeks of full-time effort by a senior engineer.  There is prior art (modestimage, work in the mantid project [this is DOE funded of that is something we care about for this text]) that can be refereed to or directly incorporated.  Due to the iterative nature of this project, any effort will be incrementally beneficial.

This will benefit users by reducing the time to generate images and reducing the latency of interactive visualization of large images. [This work will have an impact well beyond NASA.  Performance of displaying arrays is also a concern for microscopy, biomedical imaging, and neutron and xray lightsources.]

**ND Colormapping**
As discussed above, Matplotlib will color map 2D arrays for visualization via a per-pixel scalar to RGBA mapping (that is f(R^1) -> R^4).  This can be generalized to a n-dimensional to RGBA mapping (that is f(R^N) -> R^4) to support visualizing vector fields.  An example of this is to consider a 2D vector field in the plane.  By mapping the length of the vector to 'S' and the direction to "H" of the HSV color space you can visualize complex vector fields.  

This work will take 1-3 weeks by a software engineer.  Initial work on this was done by a Google Summer of Code student 2 years ago.  A proof of concept and initial implementation was completed however, it did not get merged to master.  Users will benefit by having an additional
tool for visualizing vector fields.

**Fixing marker stamping Agg**
To improve draw time when rendering many identical markers the default backend in Matplotlib (Agg) rasterizes the marker once and then 'stamps' that marker onto the canvas repeatedly.  This has the effect of rounding the location of the makers to the nearest pixel (in screen space).  This is a small shift (strictly less than half a pixel in each direction) however the combination larger default marker sizes and the rise of hi-dpi monitors has made this quantization much more
noticeable.  This problem can be alleviated by instead of rendering the marker once, rendering it several times at fractional pixel offsets and then for each marker selecting the correct stamp.

This work will take 2-3 weeks by a senior engineer and will require working on the c++ components of Matplotlib.  This will benefit users by producing less quantized plots with minimal a increase in rendering time.

## Documentation summit planning

TLDR: We are planning a 2 day documentation sprint / summit in Denver
for late summer in Denver and have some travel funds. If you are
interested in attending (either in person or calling in please fill
out the doodle poll).

There are many problems with the current Matptolib documentation:

- it is too big to effectively use (over 3k pages of content)
- it is incomplete (many methods lack sufficient API documentation and examples)
- there is no consistent voice through out the documentation
- there is no clear path through the docs
- the same content is serving many different audiences
    - existing users looking for API docs
    - new-to-python users looking for a "quick start"
    - new-to-programming/viz, but domain experts
    - new-to-visualization users starting from scratch
- two main audiences:
    - scientists/user
        - trying to solve a specific problem as quickly as possible
    - developer writing visualization apps/ software 
        - looking for detailed API docs and internal logic

These problems could be addressed by hiring a technical writer with a mandate to:

- audit and sort the existing documentation
- ensure complete coverage of API docs
- de-duplicate the examples and tutorials
    - sort out what the pre-requisites are and link appropriately
    - develop curated "paths" through examples / API doc
- develop "quick reference" sheets
- develop a template for domain specific intro material
    - implement several of these?
- develop style guide? - coding or doc? (both)
- Identify missing tutorials
- Scrape SO to determine what is missing?

and other such tasks.

The purpose of this workshop is to:

- write a work-plan for 9-12 months of work for a technical writer
    - including rough outlines, deliverable, and milestones
- write a budget (technical writer + core dev time to manage / review)
- write short grant to submit to foundations (4-6 pages, ~100k)

**general comments**

- need broad overviews / intros
- but also need a way to find detail of “how to do thing X” , discoverability
- https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation
    - django implements this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/
- documentation needs to be forward looking
- do we want to get into API rationalization / simplification
    - how to do document pyplot vs OO vs v4 (?!)
    - probably want to get our house fully in order before we hire someone

# 6 May
## Agenda
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13642: making collections autolim more robust/less clever.


## Notes

**3.1Rc2 is on pypi**
**13642: collections autolim:**

- [+In☑️ Matplotlib 2019 meeting agenda: 13642:-inverse-calculation-to-](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/In-Matplotlib-2019-meeting-agenda-13642-inverse-calculation-to-aAmENlkgepgsMeDZtlsYu#:h2=13642:-inverse-calculation-to-) 
- problem: draw markers at current limits + expand as needed, doesn’t work when markers bigger than axis limits (marker sizes in pixels/inches/etc not in data units)
- for unitized/dates uses first point from origin, creates really large pad?
- w/ scatter plot x=0, x=1, 5% margins are too large
- @Eric F does not remember any discussion around this coming in
- @Thomas C I’m sold on dropping this behavior
- @Eric F reasonable to leave to user to adjust larger markers

**PyQT4 and PyQt5** 

    can maybe just merge to qtagg / qtcairo

**14131:**  test suit fail on warnings?

- Merged

**14142/14121:** **wheels don’t need default backend?**

- wheels on pypi forced backend to tkagg
- newest wheels are fixed (?)
- changed in 3.1 RC should have new auto fall back

**13977: matplotlib.use is really just pyplot.switch_backend**
There used to be some dance around the fact that we didn’t want to import pyplot too early, but this isn’t needed anymore now that importing pyplot doesn’t “lock” the backend anymore.
Possible followup PR getting rid of the warn parameter in use(), which isn’t really useful anymore.
**color bar work**

- @Jody K is working on making colorbars follow the size of the Axes they are attached to (not it’s container) so equal aspect Axes work correctly
- has issues with tight layout
- works with constrained layout

**doc summit -** @Thomas C **write about/email explaining it** 

# 29 April
## agenda
[x] Documentation summit cc @Ryan M 
[x] 3.1rc work
[x] mpl_cairo?
## notes

**3.1 RC stuff**

- 14056: visibility settings on ticks matches draw on/off
- 14052: checks axes identity on image.contains
    - needs test (@Antony L )
    - there are nearly no artists for which artist.contains is tested; there are some basic common checks that should be done e.g. checking that the canvas matches at all.  (mplcursors, for example, reimplements most of the contains code as matplotlib’s is… too unreliable :))
- 14029: numpydoc 0.9 - merged
[ ] @Thomas C will do rc2 tonight

**mpl cairo as default**

- someone will need to sort out OSX build issues
    - need to have a recent enough c++ stdlib
    - on linux can statically link
    - looks like it is fine on windows
    - OSX 🤷‍♀️ 
        - on 10.14 the standard c++ compiler is new enough
    - requires c++17, gcc 7+/clang 5+ (https://github.com/anntzer/mplcairo#building)
- cairo handles raster + vector
    - blitting works
- anti-aliasing / offsets will be slightly different than Agg
- cairo is usually faster, but not in all cases
- cairo has the font-subsetting, rtl languages
    - some GPL encumberance, but can not be loaded
- custom blend modes 
- short term:
    - get better advertised and tested
    - AL needs to release 0.2 and then package it for arch/get it packaged for debian
- long term:
    - merge into core?doj

[x] GSOD needs second mentor
[ ] [https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/8519](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/8519)
[ ] 3.1 final process
## Notes:
- @Thomas C agreed to be second GSOD mentor, willing to be replaced

**8519: Closed figures linger in memory**

- @Eric F : we should prioritize this for 3.2
- adjust our global fixture to make sure all children are disconnected from their parents on cla
- make closing a figure making the figure dead-dead
    - clf it
    - make any further operations on it fail?
    - need to make just clicking the ‘x’ not nuke the figure
        - `fig = plt.figure(); ….; plt.show(block=True); fig.savefig(``'``my_name.png``'``)`
    - `plt.close(fig)` should aggressively clear
    - add a second list of “slightly active” figure (have had the button clicked so no longer shown, but not cleared yet) so that `plt.close(``'``all``'``)` will still find them.
        - “zombie list”
        - gives official path to being able to “resuscitate” closed figures (use case with blocking `plt.show()` in a loop with wanting to keep adding to the same figure)
    - 
    [ ] @Eric F will write this up to dev list

**3.1**

- plan to tag RC tonight

**3.2** 

- 13892: if backend not found, default to autodiscovery
    - if user uses matplotlib.use, disable fallback
    - ignore if from rcparam-background suggestion
    - suggestion: .use with backend_fallback kwarg 
# 8 April
[ ] Google Season of Docs-Numfocus needs ideas list @hannah a
    [ ] sample’s: https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/project-ideas
    [ ] particularly need answer to:
        Summarize your project's approach to documentation work: How does new documentation get written? How does existing documentation get reviewed and/or updated? How are documentation tasks shared among contributors? -same as code
    [ ] Is there anyone in the project in charge of documentation? nope, @Tim H -numpy + website, 
## Notes

**google seasons of docs** **-** @hannah a **will write up** 

- most often complaint is from data science oriented people
    - more DS oriented conceptual overview
    - more general technical overview
- might make more sense to start with an opinionated conceptual overview before launching at major refactor.
- @Eric F: what issues are DS folks having?
    - many are coming from a declarative background vs imperative plotting
    - terminology can be confusing (ex norm and colormap on images)
- start with overview
    - how mpl is different than others, ‘level setting’ / scoping / mapping
    - Matplotlib is ‘low level’,  maybe should be using higher-level library?
- what assumptions are made where
    - how to customize the “automagic”
    - why no automagic on Matplotlib
- as process, should id one or two people who can block merging, let everyone else merge

1**3826: Tick Deconflict**

- possible names
    -  `remove_overlaps` (current)
    -  `remove_minors_at_majors` (long, pinned to minor/major)
    - `exclude_minor_locs_at_major_positions` (long, pinned to minor/major)
    - `minors_at_majors` (would default to False)
        - or default to `None` 
        - set to 
    - `defer_to_major` (negative name that defaults to True, pinned to major/minor)

- concern about this property being on all `Locators` but is only consulted on minor
- general concern is that this name will be 
- looking forward, no reason to be pinned to only 2, would want many
    - that set would have to own the ordering and flags about how to handle conflicting locations
- @Eric F suggest putting the flag on `Axis` rather than `Locator`
    - @Thomas C remembers talking about this and picking on the locator, but not why.

## Notes

**Social media policy:**

- stay away from everything but python, viz, and Matplotlib
- only follow big (or Numfocus) projects

**13826****: optional tick deconflict**

- do not thread config through `__init__`, do not add property + getter/setter
- rename to `remove_overlap`

**8638:** 

- final code review, more closely match numpy’s behavior

## Notes

**Google Season of Docs**
@Thomas C will send email looping everyone in 
**13618: Minor tick supression when there are major ticks**

- on one hand, this is doing a better job of ‘doing the right thing’ in many cases where we want to de-conflict the tick labels
- but doing it non-optionally means it breaks use cases where people have been exploiting this.
- @Thomas C wants to add public API to control this, but @Antony L would rather revert the change for 3.1, push to 3.2 to give us time to think about other ways to solve this problem.
- after a bit more discussion, decided to look into adding public API for this
    - state would live on the locator
    - the axis method would ask the minor locator if it would like to be de-conflicted or not.
    - leave de-conflicition enabled by default
    - slightly open question of how many ways this will be configurable (just an attirbute, `get/set` methods, `locator_params`)
    - just going to accept that setting minor grids and not major grids may result in missing lines, users will either have to turn on all grids or use this new API

**13724: Anti-alaising**

- antialised=true in imshow, @Eric F suggests turn it into its own interpolation kwarg rather than standalone because it only works with interpolation = ‘nearest’
- kernel should expand when downsampling + filtering, probably not doing so
    - is downsampling happening before or after application of filter

[ ] Scatter relim issues: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13642
[ ] 3.1 triage
    [ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3Av3.1.0
## Notes

**13642: inverse calculation to relim to include whole marker**

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13642


[matplotlib/matplotlib#13642](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13642)

- marker in physical units, axis in data units, want to satisfy both constraints
    - empty axis breaks - wrong data transformation
    - marker size >>> data size breaks
- path & offset
    - path - transform in data units or other coordinate system
        - data - use transform to do relim
        - not in data - use offsets 
    - no path or offset - no data to draw, so no need for relim
- big markers will be clipped - consistent with old behavior
    - size clipped at not the same
    - ellipsecollection is setting in physical units, would be clipped if > axis
    - quiver also has all sorts of (multiple) units for doing things (zoom in x !- zoom in y)
- current tests used old style that clipped margins
- heuristic “what transform are you passing” could leave to confusion 
- WIP for 3.2

**13680: Seaborn style changes**

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13680


[matplotlib/matplotlib#13680](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13680)
options:

- track seaborn  - replace stylesheet with new colors
- deprecate seaborn stylesheet and replace with seaborn_v for each version (version track seaborn)
- don’t do anything & tell people to install seaborn if they want updated stylesheets
- deprecate stylesheet 
- punt to 3.2
- consensus around providing consistency by keeping old style but not adding new things to maintain

**3.1 triage:**

- 13021: Mixedmode renderer - squash baseline images/squash merge 
- 8690: rgb/rgba pcolorfast - merged
    - pcolorfast not type stable on return
- 12419: DivergingNorm - merged
- 12928: textpath encoding - @Thomas C will look at it
- 12760: dedup implementation of backend tools
    - toolmanager option can set from rcparams to let user add tools
            - needed implementation of old tools
                - olds tools are implemented as c&p of old toolbar functions
                - can instead call old toolbar functions directly
- 13689: quiver scaling bugfix - needs second look
    - blue arrows should be same length as black with corresponding angles
- punt rest of open issues (73) to 3.2, cut RC

**autolimiting for scatter**

- currently has a somewhat wonky algorithim
- todo: group discussion about changing the algorithim

**3.1 pull requests**

- 12679: compass notation WIP - Earnest is concerned about backward incompatibility in changes to notation wrt to integer location- @Antony L suggested fix in thread
- 12419: Diverging Norms:
    - @Antony L review functionality, now needs to review docs + needs 2nd review (Ernest?) 
- 13614:fix polar get window extent -merged
- 13064: don’t explicitly add default path to extensions - needs someone who groks build process to review
- 8638: hist numpy bug - if using even bins, bins things slightly differently
    - occurs when bins are a string arg like ‘auto’
    - a+a != 2*a floating point math bug
    - something goes wrong with y scale in one tests, sets y limit wrong, and goes down a decade? 
        - change tests so not sensitive to round off? 
    - ping eric weiser to see what’s the minimal fix on the mpl side  - not a blocker for 3.1?

    - why different patch color for background on save - matlabism
- RC for next week

**housekeeping agenda:**

- breaking up into months is fine
- process at start of month:
    - c & p contents of this doc into new file
    - clear out this doc ‘cause this has the public link/sharing
    - take new file & archive it by downloading as markdown in

| March 25 18:00 UTC | Student application period begins |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| April 9 18:00 UTC  | Student application deadline      |

- pysal viz project would be joint with matplotlib/geopandas
- projects:
    - Propose your own
    - fix plotting in geopandas/pysal - @hannah a needs to write this up
        - fix norms so they’re consistent/proper across subplots
    - adapt Nick Rougier 3D renderer to artist to do more proper 3D - 
        - current issue with 3D rendered is that they render separately 
        - rasterization can maybe fix this by cleaning 
        - pipeline to this, can be semi standalone
        - @Thomas C will write up this project
- numfocus:
    - https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/pull/298
    - we need to email projects to max.linke88@gmail.com, (cc seth.mridul@gmail.com)
- post banner once emails sent to max/seth

**Nearest neighbor interpolation from mailing list**

- 10x10→5x5, have to decide what to downsample
- 5x5→10x10, in theory could always say nearest neighbor, you need to manually resample
- @Ryan M - it’s both transformation between grids
- @Thomas C - out of scope for core-matplotlib
    - interpolators are in scipy (no dependency) + lots of knobs (gets into backend guts)
    - similar to datashader PR
    - @Antony L - would weigh x and y axis differently 
- consensus:
    - not unreasonable request/D3 does it
    - should start as external package/proof of concept
    - @Thomas C will follow up on the mailing list

**Read the docs**

- @Jody K will send more info gathering/sharing email


# 4 Mar 2019
## Agenda
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11692 deprecating frameon
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12513 deprecation of plt.subplot() giving the axes if it already exists?
[ ] Constrained layout and annotation boxes etc in axes-coordinates
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3Av3.1.0
## Notes

**11692: deprecating frameon**

- @Antony L: doesn’t work/has never worked because of buggy implementation

**12513: delete deprecation?** 

- 7377 - deprecation went in ‘cause plt.subplot(111) called twice wouldn’t overwrite subplot, would instead return it
- concerns:
    - @Eric F - how much user code likely to rely on this? 
    - @Jody K - people use it as shorthand for plt.gca()/set current axis 
    - @Antony L - can make a mess with projections
- **proposed**: 
    - @Jody K - keep deprecation in add_axis code path, but remove it from plt.subplots()

**GSOC:**

- collab with geopandas/pysal: https://github.com/pysal/pysal/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2019#geovisualization-module
- @hannah a needs to post to numfocus list

**12679 compass notation:**

- @Tim H - set loc can have all the things, what about get_loc?

return canonical form? 

- @Antony L - normalizing better, can also return user input (like in color) - only resolved at draw time
- `loc_real`? - locations normalized to compass notation - (might be in pull request
    - use long forms of  notation for normalization - @Antony L / @Tim H 
    - use user provided forms - @Jody K (which used to be `_loc`, but in this pr `_loc` → `loc_real`)
    - remove `get_loc` and `set_loc` until clear path proposed/agreed upon - @Tim H 

**Outstanding 3.1 PRs**

- 13064 - wait for @qlogic to rereview, then ping @Thomas C for second review
- 12928 - font encoding problem open for 2 years for SVG - needs domain knowledge of fonts/freetype for a good review 
    - @Eric F - what’s the worst that can happen if merged? 
        - @Antony L - doesn’t break any tests
        - @Antony L - problem is 8068: svg output + usetext + unicode, then displays incorrect gifs ‘cause svg gets text from dvi 
        - @Antony L unicode glyphs also sized incorrectly ‘cause extracted incorrectly
- 12367-
    - ipython has hardcoded table if <backend> agg→<backend> event loop, breaks for mpl cairo
        - should update themselves to look up attribute that now exists on the module
        - still need hardcoded table for old matplotlib
        - put in mpl rather than ipython ‘because it’ll fix for all versions of ipython
    - patch on mpl side updates the table
        - before spinning up canvas, will update ipython dict using mpl backend attributes
        - wrap this in try/catch in case ipython switches to new API in future
    - waiting a day or two for @Matthias B to give feedback,  he also invited to push patch back to IPython
- 12170 - API change waiting on @Thomas C 
- 13573 - rebase of accepted PR

**Docs -use read the docs?**

- moving to read the docs, or self hosted instance using their versioning system
- docs are 7GB
- would watch the repo, do the auto builds, manages versioning & provides hooks for exporting docs (html/pdf)
    - current stop gap: throws up banner on old texts, make robots ignore examples folder

**Constrained layout and annotation boxes etc in axes-coordinates**

- issues with extra artists on constrained layout plots
    - needs API decision on dealing with conflicts w/ artists
        - each type of thing (artists, annotations, etc) has its own way of interacting with artists that creates problems
    - @Antony L - reserve the right to change how legends interact with artists, etc. 
    - 13544 shows examples of extra artists with constrained layout 
# 25 Feb 2019
## Agenda
- 3.1 wrap up
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12839 (needs final review)
        - do we really need to be parsimonious w/ the size of the repo and new baseline images?  
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12856/ (do we want to accept private API for now or take care of public API across several (all) formatters?
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11964 (thoughts on bumping to 3.2?)
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/9913 
        - qt4 window resize bug….

@Thomas C and @P I  are having minor scheduling issues, “soon”
**12839:**

- accept the PR/override @Antony L concerns

**12856:** 

- todo:  add usetex to scalerformatter 
- needs: whats new entry
- related to larger question of how/when rcparams do their thing

**11964:**

- trust @Antony L + won’t discover edgecases until try to build wheels

**9913**

- not reproducible on mac/linux
- @Antony L cannot repro on windows+mpl3.0.3+qt5

**12716**

- can be merged? unclear what @David S intended

**11732** 

- matplotlib wheel on pypi never has test data
- matplotib-tests package would get tests
- either build from wheel - no test data, or test data from source 
- adding a rogue/hidden setup.py
- need to remove tests from default wheel

**8638**

- @Thomas C has homework to address comments



# 18 Feb 2019
## Notes
## v2.2.4 and v3.0.3 state
- just waiting for backports to finish CI

**Compass Notation for Legend Placement**

- Short & Long notion w/o spaces
    - [north, northeast, northwest,  south, southeast, southwest, west, east]
    - [N, NE, NW, S, SE, SW, W, E]
- old notation still saying

**histograms #6669**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/6669
- people want to plot histograms without recomputing histogram
    - can abuse current API to do it - 
        - pass in counts as weights & bins = bins, and bins-1 as data
    - have to pass in bins & weights 
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/6669#issuecomment-464676022
    - function that does this would be thin wrapper on hist
    - add in count kwarg and blow up if counts+weights or better doc the trick
        - pro: counts is clearer than weights ‘cause it doesn’t require understanding the trick
    - can also make x(data) optional 
        - can accidentally do something weird 
    - Sample API:
        - `ax.hist(bins=bins, weights=counts)`
            - `ax.hist(x, bins=bins, weights=counts)`  # won’t work
            - `ax.hist(x, weight=counts)` # may work depending on sizes, uses current behavior
            - con: might give users pause on ‘why are my counts weights’
            - con: documentation on weights gets a bit fussier
            - pro: no new kwargs, simple 
        - `ax.hist(counts, bins=bins, as_counts=True)`
            - `ax.hist(counts, bins=bins, as_count=some_state)`
        - `ax.hist(bins=bins, counts=counts)`
            - `ax.hist(x, bins=bins, counts=counts)` # wont work
            - `ax.hist(bins=bins, counts=counts, weights=weights)` # will raise
            - `ax.hist(x, counts=counts)` # won’t work, will raise
            - con: does not make sense with non-int ‘counts’
            - pro: bit clearer what intent is 

**closed step: 5855**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/5855
- step plot, but you want to close it
- use `where` kwarg add -auto/interlaced (in addition to pre/post)

**tick params visibility 12839**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12839
- don’t use setp for ticks, change defaults

- decided to back out of deprecating xmin/xmax

**logging - 13275**

- how to provide feedback to users → how to turn on logging→handler for the logging
- no handlers installed by default
- talk to ipython folks about adding it to %matplotlib? 
    - switch ownership over to matplotlib?
        - deferred magic? - simplifies newer backend support

    - default to None, require to say explicitly, set default to false + raise deprecated warning,  switch to True on next release - Numpy model?
        - decided against this, keep it simple. voxels is relatively new, few users, low impact.
    - ping @David S to release objections

**Summer Students**

- summer joint project between geopandas + pysal (pysal will kick in mentors)
    - emailed NF to ask if they are ok with mentors from non-NF projects

- look into doing it this way again this year

**Legend location** 

- geographic coordinates - [N, S, etc]
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13072
- upper right is ambiguous ‘cause besides or on top of bunch of axis
- need centralized documentation of how it *should* be done, then can move towards doing it uniformly.

# 28 Jan 2019
## Agenda
[x] follow up on summer studentsReviews
    [x]  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12678 (fix for timezone handling)
    [x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13128 (Parameter renaming)
    [x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13069 (default minor ticker change)
    [ ] verbose/logging method: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13275 
## Notes

**Timezone handling**

-  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12678
- timezone information wasn’t being passed into YearLocator
- alternative is don’t support timezone/assume GMT
- without passing isdst, will raise exception if time being DST is ambiguous (no timezone passed in)
    - user can pass localtime instead of datetime 
    - `dateutil` might correctly handle this
    - this is in yearlocator

**Parameter renaming decorator**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13128
- just waiting on @Thomas C 
- decorator to make functions keyword only?
    - later deprecate positional and make them kwarg only
        - would require making pyplot wrappers aware of deprecators
- merged

**Minor tick changer**

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13 069
- insist on backcompat api? 
- minor ticks not as commonly used, so should in theory have smaller ripple effects
- leave 1  and 10 at 5 ticks, because it yields a middle

**Verbose logging**

- requires multiple levels of hierarchies 
- need way to turn off mpl level logging w/o turning off other logging
    - can’t use global handler (basicconfig)
- handler needs to be publicly accessible
- this is designed for end (mostly novice) user, not library dev
    - needs to not cause ripple effects in downstream libraries/apps

**summer students**

- @hannah a spoke with geopandas, worried their project is not a full 3 months (but we suspect it is more complicated than they think)
- @Thomas C will send follow up email and include user list.

**Next release?**

- release bugfix 3.0.x soon and 3.1 in a month or so 
    - must already be in master to be considered for 3.1
- check in on https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13281
- @Thomas C will send email with announcement + asking for volunteers to help run release.
- get in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13030 (ping @Benjamin R)

**Units**

- @Antony L - datetime should be pitched to floats & stay there instead of mixed units
- places where you’d like to pitch stuff to numpy but as array destroys units (for example unwraps pint)

# 21 Jan  2019
## Agenda
[x] updates for NF annual report
        > Happy new year! We are hard at work producing the 2018 NumFOCUS Annual Report. Last year we invited all of our sponsored projects to include the main highlights of their year, and we'd like to do so again this year.
        > 
        > To keep things manageable with over 2 dozen projects, please reply to me with 2 or 3 bullet points of your 2018 highlights.
        > 
        > For example:
        > Received ACM Best Project Of All Time Award
        > Celebrated our 1.0 release
        > Brought on two new core developers, Jane Doe and John Hancock
        > Kindly send me your highlights by the end of this week if at all possible.
        > 
        > Let me know if you have any questions.
[ ] gsoc or JDH student fellowship this summer?
    [ ] if gsoc, then what should we do with JDH fellowship this year?
[ ] documentation summit
## Notes

**Numfocus Annual Report** @Thomas C **wrote it**

- I officially became lead developer, 3 new core developers (Tim Hoffman, Ernest, Dietmar Schwertberger)
- 200 unique code contributors for year (average ~26 unique contributors per month)
- One major release (3.0), one minor release (2.2), 8 total patch releases
- note about plotting contest & summer fellowship

**GSOC & JDH**

- pros: more control + good use of fellowship money
- cons: running ourselves, everyone stretched super thin
- Are there projects?
    - keep working on matplotlib altair - 
        - cons: altair is kinda dead, any mpl developer interest? 
    - propose there own projects
    - infrastructure:
        - proper webpage/documentation deployment
            - sphinx 
            - fix doc version selection - version toggle
            - google pointing to outdated docs
            - which HTMLs are associated to each other, or clean versioning 
            - python has instructions somewhere for building versioning? 
            - needs mentor 
    - put out call to devel mailing list for mentors/projects
        - run it through gsoc if mentors are new
    - models of good projects:
        - astropy, sympy
        - clear projects, milestones, fairly self contained
    - outside matplotlib + mpl related
        - fix viz in geopandas @hannah a would mentor, need run by geopandas
        - cartopy - @Ryan M & Elliot have commit bits so stuff could go in
        - factor out pandas plotting into its own package - kinda becomes matplotlib toolkit 
            - @Thomas C maybe, @hannah a maybe
        - factor out xarray plotting into its own package/clean up their visualization 
            - @Thomas C maybe, @hannah a maybe
        - seems to be an interest in geospatial / mapping extensions
        - list of things basemap can do that cartopy:
            - besides labeling lines
            - migrating basemap to cartopy
                - convert basemap examples to cartopy 
                

**Depr****e****cated/closed MEPS**

- MEP 25 (closed #3424)
- MEP 26 

**Discussion about webpage**

- looking into ways to get redirect of main page like python.org  (https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html = https://docs.python.org/library/index.html)
- bandwidth cloudflare - 2 Tb/month (780k unique users)
- each version 250 Mb - doc repo about 10 Gb.

**documentation summit**

- @Ryan M can host
- $13k  budget + small grant ($3k from numfocus)
    - 2 days, 5 - 7 travelers?
        - Have to be there: @Ryan M @Eric F @Thomas C 
        - probably: @hannah a + Dora
        - who else? post to mailing list
    - budget for flights + hotel + food 
    - work product is proposal to ask funding agency for technical writer
        - scope of work
        - milestones
        - what the document looks like in the end - (kinda like book proposal??)
    - usability issues seem to be more due to docs than code base?
    - sort out how to call people in
- possibly combine with steering council meeting (Ryan, Tom, Eric)
- last week of may/ first week of June


# 14 Jan 2019
## Agenda
[ ] Merging policy clarification 
[ ] how eager should units conversion be for x+dx (ie bar(x, width))? 
        -  Eager makes our lives easier but doesn’t allow combining units that will add but may have different converters (timedelta, datetime). https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/issues/751
        - Exactly what types are allowed as input?  `[], [unit-y objects (i.e. numbers, strings, datetimes)], np.ndarray, np.ma, unit-wrapper(np.ndarray)``,  pandas.Series`
            - documentation issue, we should specify what inputs are allowed for tuples, and what properties they must satisfy. 
[ ] scipy 2019 talk + tutorial
    [ ] @Benjamin R is not planning to go to SciPy this year, @hannah a has volunteered to teach intro-to-matplotlib tutorial
    [ ] should we put in for the interactive one as well?
    [ ] do we want to give a talk?


## Notes

**Merging**

- need to balance review strictness versus getting things merged…
- test suite not perfect and not complete
- cleanups can miss corner cases
- for core devs, make objections explicit
- more aggressive use of ‘request changes’ (red x) on review when you want:
    - changes to the PR
    - indicate that you want to close the PR, with timeline
    -  to have sign off on the PR getting merged
- use comment (no approve/reject) to not sign on as a full reviewer? 
- @Antony L proposal for core devs: 
    - if PR has one positive review & it’s been two weeks, ping devs for review
    - if month of no comment, can be merged
    - each dev can sponsor one review at a time
    - reviewers can say needs more review
    - @Jody K needs 100% code coverage 
- 2nd reviewer can just scan  & merge
## unit 

conversion:

- **containers**: arrays, lists, dictviews
- **datatype**: int, float, string, bool, datetime
- container specification of supported operators:
    - must be singleton/iterable 
        - unit aware asarray w/o data duplication + dictview support
    - something that we can call asarray on + dictviews
    - but will do unit support first (numpy strips up units)
- datatype specification of support on operators:
    - unit registry/unit specs out how datatype works
    - convertible to/from float
    - write timedelta convertor? 
- data wrapper object vs fixing units in numpy
    - FOH: unit work
    - BOH: use arrays for things
    - only duplicate memory if you’re using units? 
- **TODO**:
    - document expected unit containers
    - test united data
## SciPy
- modified Anatomy of Matplotlib by @hannah a 
    - needs assistants
## Students
- maybe @Antony L answering questions
- what sorts of projects? stand alone/isolated/doable
- low stakes, standalone, halfway done
    - discrete legend
    - colorbar refactor
    - VR  backend 
    - fix geopandas viz/other 3rd party matplotlib viz projects? 


# 7 Jan 2019
## Agenda


[ ] Eager or lazy eval of line/patch/marker properties. 
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13026 : warn all floats in strings
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13126 minor tick suppression (log scales).  
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13117#discussion_r245755479  matplotlib.use cleanup 
[ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13030 mplot 3d 
## Notes

**Matplotlib.use cleanup?**

- param re-naming discussion 
- param rename decorator? 

**Minor ticks**

- Try to pass major ticks to minor tick locators @Jody K 

**Warn on all-float string arrays** 

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13026
- hard to google,
- but we shouldn’t emit warnings for proper usage
- put in offset?  Will show up in final plot…
    - in coord format?  Category
- going in circles about how to support both the naive user which is getting things-that-work-but-are-not-what-they-want vs non-naive users who are get spurious errors for correct usage of the library (sorry for cynical summary).
- more general discussion about helping users with common pitfalls
    - plt.helpful → set logging level to Info for matplotlib.
- maybe we can just use logging.info?
- Settled on using logging
    - @Jody K will change #13026 to use logging
    - someone will open a PR to add a helper function to pyplot (and/or top-level ?) to set up the logging at info level.

**Discussion about #13030**

- deprecation is ok modulo a more documentation
- Want to enable 25% performance speed up so we can 

[**matplotlib/matplotlib#12909**](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12909)

- @Eric F format ticks method takes only values, applies particular formatter 
    - format ticks for fixed formatter should check for ticks
        - overwrite the format all methods for specific formatters

**Azure Pipelines for testing**

- make 2.6 build using vscode/windows binaries
    - ping @Antony L after New Years
- use  custom images from Qulogic because all the pngs fail because of free type 
    - push test image into their own repo & use submodules for test management
    - talk to free type about testing stability/summer students
    - email freetype and ask about testing stability?
