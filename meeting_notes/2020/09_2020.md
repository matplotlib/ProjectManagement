# 28 September 2020

## Agenda:
### Old business:

- [x] Code of Conduct (@jklymak)
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18538 : in draft form comment period announced by @dstansby.  Closed 13 Oct
- [x] Security (@QuLogic)
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18537
- [ ] Axes API movement (@tacaswell)
- [x] pcolorfast benchmarks (@anntzer)

### Issues
- [ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/18481 - how old browsers to support?
- [ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/18597 - Line2D and PathPatch have different defaults for capstyle and drawstyle 
    - Change default or just document?

### PRs
- [ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/17270 Date ticker factory

## Notes:

### Zoom 
- designate more hosts...


### Security Policy
 - PR in (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18537)
 - use an external management system? 
 - start simple - expand if needed...
 
### Browsers:
 - `ResizeObserver` not implemented in FF69 until last year, in Chrome 3-4 y.
 - Extended support release: 
     - do we need to support this?
     - not part of packaging system
     - how big is it? 
     - would need to add a shim...
         - if self contained, seems reasonable.
         - versus documenting incompatibility
     - suggest similar amount of time to python support: 3.5 y

### Consistency of defaults `capstyle` and `joinstyle`

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/18597

  - `PathPatch` and `Line2D` incompatible defaults
  - `PathPatch` hard coded.  Line off rcParam.  Add an rcParam? 
  - arrows seem hard coded
      - does it need to be on universal default?
      - specific patches need specific 
  @bruno: open issue on circle patch
  
### date ticker factory:

  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/17270
  - not particularly used.  Entry in whats new 2005
  - just deprecate.

### Stair test fixes...
  - change data:  user must call `relim()`...
  - can be useful.

### Collections color logic
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18480
  - make more reversible
  - clarify
  - allow changing the arry to go back to None 
  - needs review.  Doesn't change any tests, and adds a bunch of tests.

### 18573: axes_class
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18573

# 21 September 2020

## Agenda
### Governance
- [x] small dev grant due Oct 19th
- [x] concrete next steps for a MPL flavored CoC
    - (from 2016) https://github.com/matplotlib/governance/issues/2
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/governance/blob/master/communications_guidelines.md
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18535 was just merged...
      - missing reporting & enforcement mechanisms
- [x] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/security 
    * matplotlib@numfocus or private email group?
- [x] Meta: are governance things really best discussed on dev call?

### PRs:
- [x] Needs naming decision https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18356
    - subpanel, panel, subfigure
    - re-organizes figure, so rebases are challenging
- [x] sync shared axes tick marks
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18529
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/8946
    - Do we really want this? 
- [x] camelCase drives somePeople nuts:
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11051
    - is this *really* something we need to change?  If not, we should close.
- [x] function-based API:
    - seems to have fizzled.  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14058


## Notes

### Code of conduct

- concern is that it is actionable
	- perceived as problematic to have to go through back-channels.
- can be problematic
- do we value it?
- EDI kick?  @dstansby
- @jklymak: will move this forward...
	- back up ombudsman 
	- leah at NumFOCUS?
	- 
- try and have under unmbrella 

### Small dev grant
- small dev grant:
   - $5k if something useful we should propose...

### security email
- matplotlib@numfocus.org email as well...


### PRs
- `subfigure` is the name....

- shared axis:
  - sharing ticks and formatters are supposed to be the same...
  - currently should both be shared....
  - should just be `set_xlim`? rather than looping...

- pcolorfast, 
  - should be faster than pcolormesh....
  - but how much? 
  - @anntzer will look at benchmarks and check that new all-numpy version is close to C version...

- Axes api discussion:
  - subfigure useful to allow libraries that have control of figures...
  - decorator: global state versus non-global
  - explicit better than implicit generally
  - context manager?
  - agreed on call that this is an important project. 
  - @tacaswell will put some cycles into moving this forward.  
```python
    if ax is None: 
        ax=plt.gca(); 
```


# 14 September 2020
## Agenda 

- [x] 3.3.2 update
- [x] Default pcolormesh handling:
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/18317, https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18398, https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/18399
    - Should we find grid centers in display space
    - Warn if non-monotonic?
    - Give kwarg way to get old behaviour or just ask people to drop whichever row/column they want e.g.`Z=Z[:-1, :-1]`
- [x] Imshow round tripping (again)
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18458
- [x] Numfocus mentored sprint

## Notes
### Pcolormesh handling
* panning and zooming in non-cartesian coords
* interpolation should be in data space, creates issues w/ 0-360 wrap
* folks expect that pcolormesh works like imshow, except pcolormesh doesn't - needs to guess edges - creates issues in wrapped coordinate systems (globes!)
* user can pass in boundaries 
* projection can provide function for doing wrapping on non-cartesian coords
    * this sorta exists as transform
    * is periodic boundary problem
    * not sure if there's a canonical way of doing
* previously dropped data, would create piecewise linear condition that usually would follow circle
* want lat/lon grid or projection informed nearest neighbor 
* two projections 
    * native projection system for the axes
    * specificy alternate projection for plotting 
* original report:
    * stereopolar stored in lat lon (plattecarrer) that they wanted plotted in polarstereo - interpolation created jumps 
* cartopy side solution
    * cartopy heuristic is nan for missing 1/2 grid
    * they plan to develop algorithm that defaults over pcolormesh

#### to do
* warning: [#18398](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18398)
    

### imshow roundtrip
* value =/= inverse cmap(norm(v))
* switched to interpolation in dataspace
* agg clips hard at 0-1, so mpl internally resamples .25-.75 so rest can be mapped for over/under
* log(100*10^20) doesn't work properly - clip transform eps to 1/20
* problem restatement
    * input data < vmax
    * via interpolation gets rounded up >vmax
    * gets aggressively clipped
    * is now nan
#### proposals
* special case log
    * clip to be >+0
* 3.4 proposal: add an episilon to vmin/vmax 
    * close over values (<vmax+epsilon) will get marked as valid
    * discrete boundary on the data
    * boundarynorm does this fuzzyness
    * moves around implementation details 
    * concern about domain specific boundary values 
* current path:
    * resample (rescale/unscale - linear [0-1]) -> norm(rescale) -> colormap
* rewrite interpolator 
    * sort out the current implementation (agg implementation details) - walk through agg templates
    * for every point in kernal window, apply kernal to get interpolated point
    * still doing floating points, still mapping to integer (color mapping)
    * need to preserve input values- shouldn't happen in nearest 'cause interpolater shouldn't be doing math
    * resample & norm order are really scale/domain dependent 

#### To Do
* special case log
    * clip to be >+0
* document resample/interpolation/rescaling path & floating point issues

### mentored sprint

    * 
### PRs and Issues
- [x] TH: Naming the "good" step function. After careful consideration I've come to the conclusion that the best name is one of `stair()` / `stairs()` (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18275#issuecomment-687929859). I'd like to get short feedback if singular or plural is better.

## Notes
### naming of "step"

 - primary goal to avoid user confusion
     - avoid collision with step -> no 'step' in name even though 'step' would be the best plot
 - checked what other names were already used in this context (google "<name> plot")
     - other names already have different usage
 - no one was strongly against
 - outstanding question: stair vs stairs
 - no one can think of ambigquity with 'stairs'
 - consenuss is that "stairs" scans better than "stair" even though most other plot name are singular because in spoken english "stairs" is a weird word.
     

### seaborn wants a section on discourse
* Sounds good!
* @hannah will set it up


### pydata theme
- should we move to pydata theme?
  - maybe, but want to be able customize the colors (our colors are part of our branding)
- this should also let us use the version selector
  
### logo
- keep the cicle
- change the font

### small development grant for information architecture
 - needs a champion who has bandwidth to lead this
