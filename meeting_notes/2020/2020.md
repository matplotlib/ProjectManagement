Created a new github organization 'matplotlib-teaching', made Hannah an owner.

@tacaswell will reach out to original trendvis author to see if they are are still interested in maintaining or if we should look for a new maintainers.

Discovered you can not restirct who can make new repos -> need to invistgate outside contirbutors for triage rights.

### Teams inventory
Proposal:
 - SC (admin on governance)
 - Core (only team with write access to matplotlib/matplotlib)
 - Projects
     - domain
     - project
     - teams
 - communication and teaching
     - blog (admin on blog)
     - teaching (write/admin on tutorials)
     - docs (write access on website)
  
**@tacaswell Will re-org teams this week,also sort which repository belongs to which team**

### CS Classes 
- Keep on w/ Toronto
- our biggest limitation is review capacity
    - on one hand, having a policy makes clear we won't do anything special for course
    - on other hand, don't want to give people ideas
- concerns that these students will be less-sticky than an average new contributor
- also concerns that students won't follow through after the project is over
- Arguments:
    - review capacity + loosened merging rules
    - Mpl is not well scoped or well constrained, which can be hard for school projects
- Expectations for new contributors
    - intrinsinc motivations, 
        - motivated to help GSOC/small bursts/occasional new contributors 
        - you know that there's a funnel down to significant contributors
    - too much work: one time contributions that need to be hand held throughout the process

#### Outcomes
- The issue is the documentation
- Email Anya: Heads up + gating please 
- Tom post at bottom w/ sum up of heads up + pre-filtering for good PRs that are likely to make it in w/o hand holding and that students/profs will push through even after class ends if necessary. Welcoming but not as unpaid as TAs. 

# March 2
## Agenda 
- RSE announce blog
- meeting note babysitter
- GSOC 
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/projects/12
- Small dev grant: who to hire/how to spend the money  
- Consolidating gitter channels 
    - delete/archive gsoc, mpl-altair, community since they're dormant
- named roles
- using assign
- color cycle turn on turn off
## Notes
### RSE Hiring
 - We have hired Elliott (qulogic)!
     - https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/announcement-blog-post-E5Qm4GMpVEwGxt1DmQ2sQ (need to finish)
### meeting note baby sitting
 - need to manually sync to github at end of meeting
     - --- (menu) -> versions->sync -> push
     - ![... menu, versions is first option](https://i.imgur.com/yFJZ0wf.png)

     - need to be added to project management repository
 - need to create a new link / file each month
     - maybe move to bigger time windows?
     - update the year file that links out to each month
     - set sharing/editing permissions & publish:
         - ![sharing menu, everyone read, signed in users write](https://i.imgur.com/zC3wSra.png)

### GSOC
 - @anntzer's rolling image comparison project
     - see Iris for some perceptual image comparison setup https://github.com/SciTools/iris
     - I think https://github.com/SciTools/iris/pull/2206 was the PR that introduced it
     - [their docs on graphics tests](https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/developers_guide/graphics_tests.html#developer-graphics-tests)
 - official GSOC page https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/projects/12
 - maybe fonts, but low priority
 - maybe detexify (http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) for navigating the library
 - 
### Using assign

- ask folks if we can assign issues/PRs to them?
- assign things so they have a champion to move them along
- ask folks to (agressively) self-assign
    - expectation is that if you comment on a PR and don't self assign you have weak opinions.
    - also indicated by request-changes vs just a comment review
- "just comments" -> means "I won't block on this"
    - these things make sense for small PRs, may not work well for big PRs
        - may have a significant comment, but not be willing to take over championing the PR
    - https://doist.com/blog/decision-making-flat-organization/
    - like how pydata ranks proposals
        - -2 (will fight)
        - -1 (against, but meh)
        - 0 (neutral)
        - +1 (pro, but meh)
        - +2 (will fight)
    - this missing the pre-consensus step of "please give more information"
        - start a -2 and be willing to be moved?
    - issue is more getting engagement at all (not reaching consensus once everyone is engaged)
    - how do we get people engaged?
        - ping them directly?
        - dev list?
    - deal with over-engagement
        - assigned champion can moderate
        - but this is the minority of cases
- use draft PRs in lieu of self-assigning on issues in some cases
    - or both
- not going to solve the general problem of over-notified people
- concern is less about people on calls, more about making sure it happens for new contributors.
    - like the idea of a sponsor for the PR
    - losing good possible contributors due to their PRs languishing
- should have some sort of default timeout on PRs
    - do we want a bot?
    - start with 12-18mo timeout
- assigner does not have to do the review / decsion, just responsible for shepherding
    - the assigment can be handed off
- due to force-pushing master last month, all PRs were last touched 23 days ago
    - set up bot to start timing things out at 6 months, gives us 5 months to keep things alive
    - hope the bot gives a warning message?
    - @hannah will research bots
