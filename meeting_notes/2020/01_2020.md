## Notes

### 16255: Sidebar version info: 
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/16255
- merged

### 15440: rcParams to raise window
-  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15440
-  window management/events system needs documentation.  But not for this PR...
    -  mpl hides a lot of complexity from user, makes hard to create issues, 
    -  orthogonal to user needs, maybe doesn't need it's own project? 
-  probably mostly for people who understand windows managers.  Two raising cases mutually exclusive.
-  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/4779 <- attempt at more complete interactive docs
-  https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html#a-sample-matplotlibrc-file <- comments in rcparam template do take it into the docs
-  To Do: author needs to add what's new to right place
    -  adding whats-new different than api changes?
        - api changes is automated: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15158
        - what's new is hand crafted 'cause it's more press release
    
### 16178: labels to all lines plotted in `plot`
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/16178
- have to vectorize all the things if vectorizing one thing?
    - currently all kwargs are scalers applied to all data
    - plots, markers, colors, linestyles
- stackplot already supports this behavior:
    - https://matplotlib.org/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/stackplot_demo.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-stackplot-demo-py
    - this behavior makes sense for the plot type as y-input is inherently 2D
    - all other kwargs are passed down to each fill between as scalars 
- feature is nice on user level, complicate on library level
    - special case each keyword
    - colors is complicated 'cause can be list of RGB, HTML, or named colors
- should deprecate open ended `plot(x1, y1, x2, y2, ...)`
- labels as special case 'cause can't put labels into property cycle the way colors, linestyles, etc...
    - cycler is obscure/hard to handle/hard to remember
- User: lots of lines from 2D array, quickly label them 
    - opt 1: support w/ labels
    - opt 2: save line object & pass into legend
    - opt 3: autofind handlers/seperates labels from data
        - ```plt.legend(['abc', 'efg', 'hij'])``` 
        - ```ax.legend(['abc', 'efg', 'hij'])```
- seperating data from metadata & aesthetics:
    - labels are semantically linked to data
    - cycler/aesthetics aren't inherently semantically linked
    - bokeh vectorizes all the mappings
- concern about `ax.plot(x, [5, 6, 7], x, [1, 2, 3], label=['cats', 'dogs'])`
    - as the PR is this will fail
    - but user will probably want that to work :disappointed:

# 20 Jan
## Agenda
 - Discourse 3rd party package section 
 - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/16250 (blocking from 3.1.3, 3.2.0rc)
 - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15065 (requested on gitter)
 - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/16255 (can tweak after 2.2.5 tag)
 - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/16226 (can tweak after 3.2.0 tag)

## Notes

### Discourse -> third party (i. Cartopy)
- many third party packages don't have user forums
- 3rd party packages: 
   - [x] make a top level section, give projects subsections: https://discourse.matplotlib.org/c/development/3rdparty/18
    - default is stuff that intersects like mpl devs
    - ask packages if they want a section? 
        -  Make sure they have a contact person
        -  they can reply to about post in section: https://discourse.matplotlib.org/t/what-are-3rd-party-packages/20666
    - [x] moved https://discourse.matplotlib.org/c/development/3rdparty/

### 16226: website front page 
- @hannah will review in the next couple of hours
- [x] follow up with @Dora and @Tom on frontpage redesign timeline
- don't want frequent UI/UX changes on front page but want to improve stuff

### 16255: Version numbers in sidebar
- wants backported into 2.25
- which browsers need to be supported?
    - doesn't work on ie11

### 16250: zero-len path intersect
- just needs minor tweaks (check zero len)

### 15065: step='between' draw style...
- loop in @importanceofbeingernest to sort out resolution
- simplify
- don't change Line2D to add a new drawstyle.  Either do without a base class or make a new base class on top of Line2D. (Composition)
    - still keep ability change x & y data (will require a bit of engineering)
- maybe no 'edges' and not go to zero implicitly
- `ax.step` could return a new type...
- new method? or a new class w/o back compatibiltiy concerns...



# 13 Jan
## Agenda
- pcolor
- merge-up updates

## Notes

### pcolor
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9629
- 3 ways to match (x, y) and color
    - edges and centers (expect edges to be bigger by 1)
    - centers-center (the edges are infered by putting them between the centers)
    - corner-corner (as in gourand shading)
- pcolormesh is at the core is edge and center
- but lots of data is center-center
- people have been incorrectly assuming that pcolormesh in center-center and we silently do something defendable but not want anyone actually wants
- already have the corner-corner case covered via the 'shadding' kwarg

Decision:
 - add a kwarg to control which of the 3 layouts the input is coming in as
     - re-sample internally as needed
 - throughly document
 - start warning if the sizes are miss-matched in the default case (eventually raise)

### Postdoc/Programmer
- resumes being evaluated


### tick labels
- bunch of issues recently with `get_xticklabels` and friends
- related to a change in how we manage the visibility state and if they get returned
    - previously would only return if `label1On` was set
    - now only returns if visible
- alternative 1
    - keep filtering, add docs on how to get them all
- alternative 2
    - never filter
- *alternative 3*
    - add kwarg to filter or not
    - leave default as filter

Consensus is alternative 3 (@timhoffman will take on)

### other PR reviews
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/16189 (merged)
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/16203 (noted, @tacaswell will review)
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/16039 (merged)
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/16163 (will be closed)


# 7 Jan
## Agenda
- Meeting time- currently conflicts with @Jody K , @Eric F teaching schedule
- releases
    - 3.2.0rc3,
    - 3.1.3
    - 2.2.5 (the last one!)
- CZI is starting!

## Notes

### Reschedule meetings
- move to Mondays 3:00 EST to accommodate teaching

### Releases
- Need to find a volunteer to help with releases
    - email list to ask for ~~tribute~~ volunteer?
    - maybe put this on the plate of RSE?
- should look into adopting some more automatic tooling
    - reaver?
    - need to automate: https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/release_guide.html
- targeted releases seem good

### 15961: Opinionated setting up dev env

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15961
- [matplotlib/matplotlib#15961](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15961)
- doesn’t need backport becase process doesn’t apply to older versions

### CZI
- Need to start reviewing applicants for RSE (59 applications)

### JOSS review
- https://github.com/openjournals/joss
- needs reviewers, many viz (matplotlib) related submissions

### Job posts on social media + mailing lists

- can core devs (aka Tom) use Matplotlib channels to advertise jobs that are not Matplotlib related?
    - yes
    - yes, but case-by-case don’t want to turn in to a job board
    - no, hold to project related jobs
- consensus: nah

* Policy for advertising jobs on mailing list/discourse/twitter/etc
    - matplotlib jobs are always acceptable
    - jobs advertised by core devs is case by cases 
    - jobs advertised by other scipy stack project are acceptable for reciprocity

### security vulnerability disclosure protocol

- have one possible report
    - first in very long time
- add to docs: security reporting 
    - matplotlib-security@numfocus.org

### matplotlib development friction points
- takes too long to merge a PR
- for new features:
    -  use experimental/provisional label
        - how to alert the user to new features? 
        - scikit learn maybe has some machinary for opt in 
    - let stuff break
- large PRs
    - backward incompatable
    - change internal characteristics
- middle ground for deprecate all the things & some silent fails
    - process of maintaining back-compatabiliy is convoluted
- example: make the freetype binding private
- faster release cycle?
- make mpl dev fun again!
    - conserative versus adventurism - is mpl set too conservative?
    - might be hurting gaining & retaining new contributors 
- clearly articulating what actionable steps does the PR need to get in?
    - this is hard because conservative versus adventurous?
    - maybe different guidelines based on what users are trying to do?
        - no data on what parts of the API get hit:
            - very used private versus not so used public
            - can scrape stackoverflow
- PR ends up getting paralyzed
    - what’s the next step,
    - who makes the decisions?
    - what features should be encouraged
    - where is the emphasis in development
- Major library selling points
    - stability
    - good design
    - relability
- on controversional PRs, hard to gauge how much someone really cares
    - having named champions for PRs 
        - named roles are bigger picture  leads
        - two core devs with strong opposing opinions - 
            - champion mediates 
- middle phase
    - enough active people to get opinions on a PR
    - nobody feels empowered to push the green button - champion would push it
- Summary 
    - conservative vs adventorous -  gone too conservative
    - 3rd party packages 
        - good example: mpl-finance taken over by finance expert
        - bad example: axes grid is unmaintained
        
#### Takeaways: How to make development fun again
- getting big stuff in is hard
    - may break API
    - we have become (too) cautious about adding new API
- how to balance velocity vs not making mistakes?
    - how to tune this dial?
- how to label stuff as experimental with expectation of near future breakage
- all work is either trivial or impossible / takes years
- named roles / assigned champions on PRs
- we should talk to Andy about how sklearn is this working on
- would faster release cycles help?
- would help with attracting and keeping new contributors
- maybe slim down the existing API

### Meeting notes: move to hackmd?**
- https://hackmd.io/
- [x] make old notes read only
- [x] export 2019 to repo
- [x] consolidate notes and start it on the hackmd
