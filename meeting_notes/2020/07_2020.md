- [ ] Scipy Update?

## Notes

### GSOD

- Apps due Thursday
- A few proposals

### How to contribute:
- dev mailing list for features?
- should go to github?
- process for new feature to be discussed
- Yes, just guide people to github

### New `constrained_layout`
- some discussion
- would be good to get in soon so it can work in master over the next few months.

### Spelling `:type:`

  - Issue: 
    - things like Line2D's [`linestyle` arg](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.lines.Line2D.html) and LineCollection's [identical arg](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/api/collections_api.html#matplotlib.collections.LineCollection) are redundant bits of docs,  want to link to something like: https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/line_demo_dash_control.html instead of a random method's docs.
    - Also things like Bbox/extents/etc are not always documented everywhere they are used: https://twitter.com/ecpensiveLife/status/1278994553111011328
  - color does this
  - issue with plain-text version of docs versus sphinx-directive
  - glossary module?
    - would need to teach
    - include a hint? 
- variable docstring interpolations mappings?
- concerns about injecting too much ceremony / sphinx details into the docstrings 
- consensus that "glossary" approach seems like it's a good approach initiallly
    - since the important part is consolidating the docs themselves, we can discuss more about exact "spelling" once we have this
- Jody: should we instead make sure that the individual class that *uses* these individual "concepts" gets a glossary?
- The "glossary" appears to have grown into the idea that we should actually have dedicated Class's for these individual concepts, so that we can centralize not just the documentation (without the need for Sphinx roles), but also have the class own the validator and rcparam serializer.
- For GSOD, I'll propose primarily the actual centralization of the documentation as a first step, then the "glossary" style with some comments about alternate approaches.
