### Old business
 - [x] RSE updates
 - [x] grant updates
 - [x] [name=hannah] numfocus coc: 
    - recommend or response version? From Kamila (Numfocus):
        - **response**: "NF CoC WG will handle communication with the reporter and reported person. Any bans, or permissions restrictions would be rather on Project's since NF CoC WG will not have a physical possibility to do that. In some cases NF CoC WG would also need some help from a Project to contact the reported person, since they might not have a contact." "your community is obligated to implement the WG decision."
        - **recommend**: "all the actions and communication with reported and reporting person is done by a Project", "The main argument here is that the report will be worked on by an external, independent, trained Working Group."   you just need to acknowledge that you received the recommendations and you will consider them." "There is no defined path for what would happen if the decision would not be implemented. It's a matter for discussion.

## Notes

### COC

Underlying questions: 
- Do we trust Numfocus to handle this well?
- If we were doing it ourselves, or would want to handle things differently, how different would the outcomes be?

Numfocus modes:
- response:
  - pro: we as a project don't have to deal with it: we don't have to set up rules and procedures how to handle CoC issues
  - pro: we are not experts and can delegate appropriate handling of the topic to a third party (like we do with legal stuff)
  - pro: having a third party handling this removes possible conflict of interest
  - con: concern is that recommendations won't align w/ projects values 
  - con: Project is yielding what might be viewed as a responsibility.
- recommend: 
     - needs codification/process for communicating decision w/ reporter + reportee + process (w/justifications) for amendments
    - Whole process could be slower. Does that make for a better outcome, or worse, on balance?

Proposal 1: go with response; if it doesn't work out, switch to recommend, or ditch Numfocus COC help.

Proposal 2: go with recommend; if it becomes a burden or causes problems, switch to response.

### Old business
 - [x] RSE updates
 - [x] grant updates
 - [x] [name=hannah] numfocus coc: 
    - recommend or response version?
        - response - numfocus working group manages consequences & enforcement
        - recommend - matplotlib COC commitee manages consequences & enforcement  (WG gives recommendations)
    - multiple projects want clarity on moderation guidelines, Numfocus suggests using online event guide for now

### New business 
## Notes
### RSE updates
- kyle
    - scipy talk propsoal in
    - Cleanup of 3.10.1 release (docs/announcement/etc)
- elliott
    - on vacation!
- tom
    - some review

### CoC updates
 - two modes of opting-in
     - respond
     - recommend
 - discussion of prompt moderation is a common discussion across projects
     - one way to think about this is all maintainers are delegated "event staff"
     - NF is working on clarifying guidance for this

## Agenda
### Old business
- [x] RSE Updates
- [x] NASA status
- [x] [name=hannah] [bluesky verification](https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial)
    - @matplotlib.matplotlib.org
        - allows for @*username*.matplotlib.org if we wanna allow third party packages to register 
    - @matplotlib.org
        - technically we can do both -> @matplotlib.org doesn't prevent @*username*.matplotlib.org 

### New business

### Issues and PRs
* review backlog:
    - [name=hannah][Fix behaviour of Figure.clear() for SubplotParams](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/27183)
    - [x] [name=greglucas]Order of setting norm changes depending on colorbar on figure or not https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/29522
    - [x] [name=hannah][hatchcolor in collections](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/29044) 
        - versioning backends
        - using GraphContext instead of parameter list in `draw_path_collection`
## Notes
### Nasa grant 2024
- still moving (on both sides)

### RSE updates
 - Kyle:
     - still making progress on data prototype work
     - working on organizing, getting everything on one branch
 - Tom:
     - some review
 - Elliott:
     - work on website
     - no complaints about discourse so will turn off old droplet
     - preparing to move main website droplet to f41 (from f39)
     - email sending on discourse
         - had no DMARC records
             - things that go into DNS that say to check other verications (that we do have setup)
         - set DNS to say "please check and report errors"
             - will get reports if it fails

### bluesky
- going with `@matplotlib.org` does not prevent adding user names in the future
- go with the simpler
- @story645 will do bluesky side, @QuLogic will do DNS side

### linkdin
- have a ticket in to get control of matplotlib company page

### order of setting norm changes depending on colorbar on figure or not
- can autoexpansion go into drawing of the images on collection so that it would autoexpand the norm
    - mayb norm?colorbar? fail at drawtime, maybe warning but draw correctly 
        - problem is that colorbar is calling an eager draw_without_rendering? 
            - for calculating the values from the norm 
        - potentially move the autoscale logic out of colorbar into colorizer 
        - or move the computaion/resolution logic to colorbar `.draw`
            - might have singular value problems 
    - Move singular expansion logic on the colorbar over to the Norm autoscaling logic
        - This may impact people who draw images without colorbars because previously the images would choose the "low" color, whereas we would autoexpand symmetrically.
        - Do we have issues with auto-expansion and different scales like a LogNorm choosing the non-center color for a singular norm expansion.
        
### hatchcolor collections
- managing 3rd party backend compatability 
- potentially changing the backend interface w/ a versioning interface 
    - possibly moving towards graphic context dataclass 
    - what would be needed to support more backends? 
        - potentially can transforms be movable? (intermediate layers for supporting 3D?)
            - current backend API has a lot of fallbacks if backend doesn't support more specific method
- discussion continued on PR 


### 3.10.1
- maybe next week

### New business
- [ ] [name=hannah] What to do about X (contingent on Pawel attending the meaning)
- [x] [name=tacaswell] wheel policy
    - propsoal: if all our compiled dependencies have have wheels, CIbuildwheel will build it, the build is a reasonable time, and someone asks for it, then we will build that platform.  Tier 1 and Tier 2 platforms we build wheels for (https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/) will block a relaese if the wheel builds are failing, all other platforms do not block a release and wheels may be skipped


## Notes
### Introductions

### RSE updates
- Kyle
    - rebuilt and republished 3.10
    - continue on data-prototype stuff (mostly line and image so far)
- Elliott
    - took care of Fedora build issues
        - expand tolerances to additional archs, there is PR
    - font work is on going, need to open PRs
        - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/29356 
- Tom
    - not much, some paperwork

### wheels
- propsoal seems good, @tacaswell will write up

### twitter

- [ ] [name=tim] [Grouped bar chart PR #28560](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/28560) is ready for review
- [x] [name=scott] Numpy vectorization speedups in [3D plot_wireframe #29399](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/29399) broke some plots. The potential fixes in [#29435](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/29435) all change the return somehow. Revert? 10x speed difference.
- [x] [name=scott] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/29287 ready for review

## Notes
### RSE updates
- Kyle
    - more pyplot compatibility with data prototype
    - roll out plan
        - start with separate project on pypi
- Tom
    - some review work, CI work
- Elliott
    - finishing up performance work
        - got 17% memory and 35% runtime savings in RGBA pipeline (avoid copies!)
    - look at making colormapping step faster by going to c++ and removing a lot of copies
        - looks like there may be a factor of 4 available
    - showing up as a problem now due to 3.10 change to interpolation stage
        - when interpolating in data space always colormap a "small" array
        - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/769f7a49403a8f520f0a0283d8744a98b7ed761d/lib/matplotlib/colors.py#L770-L838
        - np.vectorize didn't help
        - numexpr or numba might help, but not acceptable as deps
    - looking at failing builds on fedora
        - may need updated tolerances on non-x68_64 platforms
    - font work?
        - PRs next week



### replite
- start on docs landing page (stable/index)
    - make sure it builds before moving it around 
    - make sure not putting heavy network load in most common pages 
- potentially move the live repl to quickstart 
- adding repls and launch buttons to examples is downstream PR

### grouped bar charts
- ready for review

### 3D things broke
- looking at how to preserve speedups without breaking non-square wire frames
- most of the speedup was in the autoscale code, maybe call that twice rather than forcing a ragged array with nans

### discussion about color map
- why do we do lookup?
    - general method that works for all color maps
    - has performance benfits
    - some discritization artifacts still possible with our default size
    - intentionally using a small number of samples when can lead to better compressed pngs

### multi-dimension colormap
- @tacaswell will look today or tomorrow
- needs review
- adds extra call signature to `imshow`
- pay attention to docstrings


### what to focus on in grouped bar chart

## Notes

### RSE updates
- Tom
    - time off
    - python-build-standalone 
        - https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6893#issuecomment-2565965851
    - some review
- Kyle
    - some time off
    - working on planning the next 2 months of work
    - catch up

### what big stuff is in the pipe?
 - bivariate colormap (has PR, needs review)
 - bezier work (from Bruno)
 - PR to vectorize 3D code 
     - some have been resurected by Scott
 - font work! (raq)
 - groupbar chart
 - what artists get a label attribute
 - start to look at ticks


### [labels](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/29422)
 - to ideas:
     - want to have a unique id so you can select artist by name [2](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/29429)
         - sometimes people (ab)used the label API for this
     - label is top-level artist property to be used in legends even on things that should never be in the legend (like the Legend itself or the whole figure)
