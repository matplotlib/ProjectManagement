- @tacaswell will reach out to Sylvain 

### Interactive editing

While talking about the common user-ask for click-and-drag functionality to tweak plots.  (Doing this opens up several cans of worms, and it was agreed is a bad idea overall). Instead:

####  Tooltip for identifying objects post-plotting

After ruling out interactive editing, we talked about instead giving the
user a hover-over tooltip that tells them the 

1. Type of the object (e.g. Tick, Line2D, etc), to allow them to look up docs
2. How the object was created (e.g. plt.boxplot, plt.errorbar, etc) to help them see what other options they have for creating the data, and what function's output they need to save to modify this object (so they can go back and change e.g. `plt.plot()` to `ln, = plt.plot()`).
    a. Talked about co-opting objects' `label` field to save what function created it.

https://www.figma.com/proto/r72pulK4ADLXFGT0eDLHQI/Matplotlib-Brochure-Site?node-id=2:127&viewport=843,-1694,1&scaling=min-zoom

- would build with html+css
    - rely on plain css, not bootstrap
    - expect to be primaliry editing news and anoucements
    - aim to make the html clear enough to have big "EDIT HERE" flag
    - Content Mangement System may be useful, but probaly overkill
    - also make it easy to edit highlighted plot
    
#### CZI updates
- Draft: https://github.com/matplotlib/CZI_2021-03_mpl
    - 15% of Caswell, 100% of Elliot, travel
- Melissa Mendonça is leading the DEI call
    - mpl + scipy + numpy + pandas
    
    
#### 3.4 status
 - merged last PR, need to do manual backport
 - tag tonight!

#### Image interpolation
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18487 (docs of current state)
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18782 (add flag to do interplotion after RGBA mapping)
- Doing resampling before color mapping or after is mixing data manipulations and visual operations
- There are applications for both
- Could we get away with an example?
- @tacaswell and @QWhXj01mSwmTjk5kN1H_qQ (aka Eric) agree too much, defer this discussion until all positions are fully represented :)

### march meeting
abstract https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR21/Session/L61.5

> Data visualization is critical to understanding data in physics. Visualization is important in the early stages of understanding a measurement or a model and, later, in communicating it clearly. Physicists need to produce visualizations that fit their specific problem, often including multiple axes or novel plot types. They need tools that make common tasks like scatter and line plots easy and complex tasks like compound figures possible.

> Matplotlib is the foundational data visualization library for the Scientific Python Ecosystem. It is used by working physicists, from high-profile projects like LIGO and the Event Horizon Telescope. to the day-to-day work of students, for interactive exploratory visualization and publication-ready figures.

> This talk will highlight some of the key features of the library, focusing on examples of interactive multi-scale visualizations and tuning figures in preparation for publication. I will also briefly discuss our future plans to evolve the library to meet the future needs of our users.

### PRs
- [ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14508 force_zorder
- [ ] https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/19544 Listed colormap and sets?
    -  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/19574 similar in that changes broke some objects that used to work

Not urgent, but needs discussion:
- [x] formatting style for classes/concepts in the docs: `` `.Figure` `` vs. Figure vs. figure
      https://53849-1385122-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/doc/build/html/devel/style_guide.html#terminology
      https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/19183

## Notes

### Webpage

- front page make just html @tacaswell
    - make a different landing page
    - keep style?
    - sphinx as well? or bare html/css
- flash page should be styled?
    - add css styling to redirect pages...

### Numpy 1.17
- 3.4? 
- hard runtime check versus building wheels
- are we testing 1.16? for 3.4
- Don't bump runtime check and do bump wheels.  Make sure we are testing 1.16 if we don't block.
    - @QuLogic

### 3d zorder
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14508 
-`computed_zorder` = True for normal compute, False for user-specified.

### ducktyping arrays
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/19574
- what ducktyping will we do?
- issue with hist and boxplot are issues...
    - list or arrays
    - tensorflow?  scalars are itterable... 
- sorting out ducktype
    - iterables are special: `atleast_1d`
- lists, numpy, pandas, astropy, pint
    - need mock object
- need a common base like 
    - https://data-apis.org/blog/array_api_standard_release/

### color issue
 - @jklymak will work w/ seaborn to fix

### Figure/figure/`Figure`
- "Figure" for "Matplotlib" figures. "figure" for general figures, and "``Figure``" when discussing the class.

### axes reuse :tada:

#### Case 1

Also see #10700

This should produce 2 polar plots with sin^2 in the top one and cos^2 in the bottom one.

Correct in 2.1.2, 3.3.4, my PR, wrong on default branch

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('tkagg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
th = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1024)


plt.figure()
plt.suptitle(matplotlib.__version__)

plt.subplot(211)
plt.plot(th, np.sin(th)**2)
plt.subplot(211, polar=True)
plt.plot(th, np.sin(th)**2)

plt.subplot(212, polar=True)
plt.plot(th, np.cos(th)**2)
plt.subplot(212)
plt.plot(th, np.cos(th)**2)

plt.show()
```

#### case 2

This should produce two polar plots each showing sin^2 and cos^2 in blue and orange (C0, C1)

Correct in 2.1.2, 3.3.4, my PR, wrong on default branch
```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('tkagg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
th = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1024)

plt.suptitle(matplotlib.__version__)
plt.subplot(121, projection='polar')
plt.plot(th, np.sin(th)**2)
plt.subplot(122, polar=True)
plt.plot(th, np.sin(th)**2)

plt.subplot(121, polar=True)
plt.plot(th, np.cos(th)**2)
plt.subplot(122)
plt.plot(th, np.cos(th)**2)

plt.show()

```

#### case 3

In 2.1.2 and 3.3.4 this produces a 3D plot on top and 2D plot on the bottom

on the current default branch this produces a 2D plot on top and a 3D plot on the bottom

on the PR branch produces 2 3D plots

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('tkagg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import mpl_toolkits.mplot3d

plt.figure()
plt.suptitle(matplotlib.__version__)

plt.subplot(211)
plt.subplot(211, projection='3d')

plt.subplot(212, projection='3d')
plt.subplot(212)

plt.show()

```
#### to do
* soft deprecate polar=true? 
- proposed behavior
    * if new_proj & new_kwarg is None, return old
        ```python
        plt.subplot(211, polar=True)
        plt.subplot(211)
        ```
    * if old_kwarg = new_kwarg & old_proj=new_proj, return old
        ```python
        plt.subplot(211, polar=True)
        plt.subplot(211, polar=True)
        ```
        ```python
        plt.subplot(211, polar=True)
        plt.subplot(211, projection='polar')
        ```
    * if keyword or projection don't match, return new
    * change 3D to match new behavior
        ```python
        plt.subplot(211, polar=True)
        plt.subplot(211, projection='3d')
        ```
- 3D break - currently this behavior makes a new plot
```python
plt.subplots(111, projection='3D')
plt.subplots(111)
```
* deprecate Axes3D adding itself

## Agenda

### Old business

### New business
- [ ] 3.3.4 tagged!
- [ ] status of 3.4
- [ ] NumFocus Annual Report Survey (maybe is steering council responsibility?)
  * We would like to include three (3) applications to show how your project is being used currently. If you know of a  specific user e.g. company, research institution or university please include.  
  * Please provide a short description of three (3) future or planned features/upgrades for your project.  These would be things that you have outlined in your project roadmap and/or next steps for your project.
  * One of the intentions of these one-pagers is to be shown to potential funders. Funders want to have a quick understanding of the needs of a project so they can see where there may be alignment with their mission and identify places where they may be able to provide support. Please describe three (3) project needs PLUS a high-level cost and/or "hours-to-complete" estimate.

### Isues and PRs
- [ ] Website SEO
    - now have a `/stable/` level
    - upgrades of `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`
    - need to fix canonical urls (pointing to `/3.3.3/` or root; nothing points to `/stable/`

## Notes

### Pickradius:
- [#19039](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/19039) picker/pickradius
- pickradius can be modified.  Could also set by passing to picker (`set_picker(5)`).  Issue is `True==1`, `False==0`.
- decouple, make `set_picker` on and take a radius...
- deprecate `set_pick_radius`?

### SCM tools for setup
- for making dev versions.
- [#18971](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18971)
Decision: Make setuptools_scm an install_requires but only for dev installs (by dynamically manipulating install_requires in `setup.py` depending e.g. on checking the filesystem). In `__init__.py`, do generate the up-to-date version from setuptools_scm, but gate that behind a module-level `__getattr__` to avoid the import penalty.


### No fill markers
- [#17850](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/17850) Coloring no-fill markers
- filled and unfilled markers (versus unfillable)
    - `color` behaves differently for each type.
    - `markerstyle(fill_style='none')` but internally still has a facecolor.
    - PR is right behaviour, but could merge because it does "right thing", but architecture is messy
    - deprecate mutating `MarkerStyle` if it ever worked...
- should be sure this still works w/ seaborn...

### relimits on some artists

- `add_artist` could inspect and dispatch to the specialized functions.
- but @QuLogic has PR to flatten list anyway..
    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18216
- 3.5 issue

### Webpage
- possible SEO improvements
### GSOC:
- 29 Jan deadline
- Aitik Gupta interested
- @tacaswell, @bruno 
### Scipy 2019
- tutorial - email dev list + DM some folk 
    - Peter McKeever said yes
- talk - wait & hear, by invite
### Qt6/gtk4
- same as qt5: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/19255
    - single qtagg or different backends for each
    - similar enough? - yes

## Notes

### Numfocus annual report

- crib from CZI report. - 

https://github.com/matplotlib/CZI_2020-07_mpl/blob/main/CZI.md

```
The current grant is supporting one developer at 40% (Thomas Caswell), one graduate
student (Hannah Aizenman) with partial summer support for her advisor (Michael Grossberg), and a full time
Research Software Engineer.  For the latter we ran a search and hired
Elliott Sales de Andrade who started in mid-March.

Elliott has focused on the maintenance and support aspect of the
grant.  We hit our target of a net reduction of open PRs by 50/quarter
and are making progress on reducing the number of open issues.  Our
initial estimates of the effort per issue closed were too optimistic;
however, we merged several mid-sized and high-impact projects
(documentation, JavaScript modernization, and a complex axes layout helper).
Additionally we drafted new governance and contributor onboarding
guidelines and had 2 feature and 4 bug-fix releases.


We presented our new architecture ideas to the scientific library development community at the SciPy 2020 maintainers track.  We designed the prototype API to have a clean separation between the `DataSource`, `Artist`, and rendering layers. We started implementing sample DataSources and Artists to formalize and validate the interface between them. Because the prototype is still developing rapidly, we are postponing working with a downstream partner until the API has stabilized.

### transform copying

- should deepcopy really freeze?

### [#18216](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18216)
- get rid of individual lists of artists
- do for 3.5

### [#13306](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13306) Qt signal handling
- @pXw4hSgTQF2--OciPYwa1w will look at it.

### [#10008](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10008) and [#17850](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/17850)
- color, facecolor, edgecolor overlapping arguments 
- issue is some markers are "fillable" or not.  
- Tim will look carefully at #17850

## Notes

### Copyable Norms
- make a mixin for each of the transforms in `scale.py` rather than a new base class.

### Baseline images mathtext in SVG
- SVG with embeded paths versus text?
- paths embeded in end-user code
- but smaller if we don't embed...
- Thomas planning to prioritize the separate repo for test images

#### Conclusion:
- Take font spec improvement (it's independent anyway)
- Limit baseline images to SVG
- Don't use fonts in the SVG but keep the fonts being converted to paths.
  Concern is on the added complexity; and the production code uses converted paths, so testing these is closer to the production case. We live with the larger SVG size due to paths in test images for now. Tom is planning to prioritize the separate repo for test images, so image size is a little less critical.
