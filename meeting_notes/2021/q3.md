# Oct 14 2021
## Agenda
### New business
 - let into GH issues beta: https://github.com/features/issues

# Oct 7 2021
### Old Business
- Hacktoberfest: Note guidelines for overlapping PRs
- 3.5rc01 released

### New Business
- PRs:
    - 279 open
    - `is:pr is:open draft:false`: 34
    - 54 closed in last week

### PRs and Issues

#### Website
- Front page work?
- [Proposed further re-org](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/21251)
    - All (almost) rst under `user/`

#### Other
- [scatter etc accept None in list](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/21270)
    - probably not?
- [scalar mappables accept units](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/20962)
- [asinh symlog-like scale](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/21178)
    - locator is idisyncratic (though author points out one could easily use symloglocator)
    - do we need another scale?
- [inset_axes API OK for other "locatable" axes](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/21283)
    - Maybe inset was not general enough a name?


## Notes

### Front page

- need new pictures
    - uses the 4 we have as baseline
- need binder link
- some duplication?
- 

### Webpage reorg

### None in list
- hard API to support; we dont' want to have to figure out everywhere.
- folks want None as default in iterables, but we want to evaluate early
- `None` on its own is troublesome enough
-  User can supply a list and its not that hard to include the defaults
-  Issues with `NaN` vs `None`.  
-  @tacaswell  will write

    * https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20923

* docoverhaul (documentation: overhaul) tag 
    * for documentation issues/prs that are major revisions of existing docs
    * pro: differentitates from small documentation issues 
    * https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocoverhaul

* blog author/community participant guidelines
    * does spamming github get your contributions revoked? no new contributions/any consequences

* specified cursive font family isn't available on CI
    * https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/20945#issuecomment-909731013

## PRs and issues

* Raise warning and downsample if data given to _image.resample is too large
  Do we want to downsample or simply refuse data that is too large?
  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/19368#issuecomment-915011674 ff.


## Notes
### Stundent contributors
 - no one has time and is jumping at taking this on
 - the requested work overlaps greatly with the CZI DEI CEL job description
 - respond to them with
     - would like to defer answering to after CEL starts
     - ask about their timelines
     - suggest that familiarity with using Matplotlib as a user very very helpful to contributing

### docoverhaul tag
- sure
- also use this tag to say "needs 2 reviews"

### CoC violations by blog/third party

- case by case
    - spammy PRs -> just block
    - serious behaviour issues -> remove their blog posts
- as always handle with compassion / empathy and response that fits the infraction

### Issues with pgf fonts
- the docs suggest in multiple places that setting `rcParams['font.serif'] = []` will cause pgf to fallback to the default latex serif font, but the code is currently falling back to dejavu sans in this case
- @anntzer is running an auto bisect


### image resample
- downsample - agg accepts 2**15, if someone passes higher **warn** and downsample

### 21015: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/21015
- rcparams.copy returns plain dict including deprecated ones, 
- when they restore, mpl emits working
- instead copy will return a new rcparams instance
- don't need to emit new warnings on update
- concern: rely on validators w/ sideeffects
    - date.formatter which globally sets default formatter
    - validators need to know if they're working on installed or other rcparams
        - when an rcparam is set, the validitor can/does set global state  
        - validators should only be validators
            - shouldn't have side effects,
            - should be allowed to convert values 
        - changing state should be a different function
            - dictionary of sideeffects/call backs
- conclusion: 
    - remove side effects from validators
    - change .copy behavior to return instance, skip warning and revalidate

        


# Sept 2 2021
### New business
* 3.5.0b1 aftermath



* ipympl contract signed

## Notes
### update on docs
* Caswell did not make suffient progress, but should be possible, will continue to work on

### 3.5.0b1 fallout
 - starting to do dependent builds on koshi (fedora)
     - most issues posted to gitter, big things are seaborn issues
     - cartopy issues 
         - more fallout from changing the order of the artists
         - used to be stable zorder sort based on what sub-list they were in
         - now stable sort based on order added
         - unfortunately contour and coastlines are same z-order and if you add coastlines first, then the render order is switched in 3.5
         - maybe fixable on the cartopy side by changing default z-order to depend on line vs filled
 - 3 or 4 packages that fail, but their upstreams have fixed themselves!
 - discussed proposal to add small (multiples of 1e-7) to zorder passed
     - can adjust the z-order on the way in
     - could add z-bias to the classe
     - could just make clear in the docs
     - could just warn if order has changed
 - core of the problem is we used to to z-sorting on (z-order, type, added-order), now it is only (z-order, added-order)
     - this change fixes (very old) bug in errorbar when caps/lines had different relative z-order
     - seems hard to both warn / give back compat in cases when this breaks a user and not when it fixes the user (like errorbar)

Approximatly old order:
```
    def get_children(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return [
            *self.collections,
            *self.patches,
            *self.lines,
            *self.texts,
            *self.artists,
            *self.spines.values(),
            *self._get_axis_list(),
            self.title, self._left_title, self._right_title,
            *self.tables,
            *self.images,
            *self.child_axes,
            *([self.legend_] if self.legend_ is not None else []),
            self.patch,
        ]

```
https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1622

- 

**consensus** : 
 - get cartopy release out
 - Accept the breakage which is really a fix, but make sure it is well documented

# Aug 26 2021
## Agenda

### Old Business
 - ipympl contract is moving, target start of Sept 1!

### New Business
- "inner" index page re-organization https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/20867
- "outer" index content https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-brochure-site/pull/2
    - what to put in the big gray box?
    - What to put on the otherside of the binder link?
    - Should we check-in with the highlighted projects and get their feedback on their description?
    - where to point the row of big links to (only user guide currently seems off to me)?
    - 

### PRs and issues

#### 3.5 relevant

- Should the new colormap registry be experimental? https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/18503#issuecomment-898873054
- Naming of the new method `fig.draw_no_output()` https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20001#issuecomment-825445132
- Change in contour return type https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20906
- Instability in where boxplot artists are https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20895


## Notes
### 3.5 relevant
- colormap registry as experimental?
    - pro: gives us a chance to tweak the API as we see its use
    - con: would have to back out a bunch of docs
    - conclusion: will add note that this might be changed
- consider adopting a sklearn style "turn the experimental stuff on" helper functions (more general)
    - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.experimental 
- do we want to add `plt.colormaps` which provides access to the registry
    - can probably never deprecate `plt.get_cmap`
    - is it worth providing 2 ways `plt.get_cmap(name)` vs `plt.colormaps[name]`
    - already have a version of this duality in `plt.rcParams[]` and `plt.rc()`
    - do we want to delay to 3.6?
        - pro delay: delay exposing new stuff out
        - con delay: there is no API freedom here, might as well do it now
- `draw_no_output` vs `compose`
    - `draw` -> walks tree + renders 
    - suggestions: `draw_no_render` or `draw_without_render`
        - alt is `fig.canvas.draw()`
    - consensus: `draw_without_rendering`
- change return type contour
    - needs API note
    - backcompat shims? LineCollection->PathCollection
        - add a get_segments function that raises warning/error
        - add a LineCollection keyword argument to change the return type?
            - allows a longer deprecation cycle for downstream libraries

    - consensus: API note, revisit backshim if needed

- box plot return instability
    - previously 
        - box plot always went to artists (as Line2D)
        - now can show up in patches list if using `patch_artist` keyword 
    - transition path
        - remember the `patch_artist` keyword to direct traffic
        - keep it in both?
        - on artists can warn if adding a special artist, but plan is to consolidate to `add_artist` 
    - consensus: 
        - check that there is an API note that things added to artists may appear in special artist type list

### website
- inner index
    - https://63094-1385122-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/doc/build/html/index.html

- top level in contents
  - usage
      - plot types
      - tutorials

# Aug 19 2021
* Meeting canceled due to low attendance
* informal PR review session for 3.5 PRs


# Aug 12 2021

## Agenda

### Old Business

### New Business
* Small Dev Grant, $5000, due September 3, 2021

### PRs and issues

- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/20518
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/20603
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/20611
- Semantics of `ax.cla`

## Notes

### Ipympl
- draft statment of work to Sylvain Corlay

### Small dev grant
- $5k numfocus...
- previous: macmini access
- 1000 words total (750 what, 400 why)

### 20518: pgf sketch params
- pgf and non pgf scaling of wiggles should ballpark look the same

### 20611: spanselector
- rectangleselector used to give the click and release points 
     - now tells the extents of rectangle - (upper right, lower left?) 
        - encapsulated as mouse event
    - fixed to go back to start/end, but for interactive breaks if you want location
    - rectangleselector shouldn't care about order of creation, just size + position
- options:
    - change docs: always get how rectangle looks but not where user clicked
    - two events: one is location, second is how rectangle was effected
- close w/o merging
- #9608:
    - needs to either be closed or a comment on what's the actionable next step
    - actual fix might be new feature: vectorselector widget?
        - grabbers on ends of vector
        - order cares about start/stop
        - zoom provides keyboard short cuts to only go in x or y
    - fix docs & treat as feature request


### ax.cla
- init: axes cleared when created
- not defined what it does when clearing an axes
    - what is a pristine axes?
    - does clearing go back to creation (including projections/kwargs) (clear all)
        - projection is part of classes
        - maybe recreate w/ it's kwargs?
            - w/o kwarg about clearing to remove recursiveness
        - how do changes to rcparam factor in?
            - clear w/ rcparams as they are at call time/context
    - is it just remove artists/data? (clear children)
        - does that propagate down to ticks/how?
            - everything is stored on the axes object (in axis children)
            - end up forgetting shared axes
        - label contents or also styling?
- Tom: go back down to what was passed into init
    - what does this mean when styling like facecolor is passed in?
- change names/add
    - reset/reinit: go back to new object w/params
    - kill children/relim/clear data: remove child artists

## Agenda

### Old Business


### New Business
- cross Numfocus projects user forum
- donation from Junolabs?
- PR Status:
    - `is:pr created:>2021-07-21 draft:false`: 17 Opened, 13 closed
    - `is:pr merged:>2021-07-21`: 20

    - `is:pr is:open draft:false` : 32
    - `is:pr is:open draft:false -author:anntzer` : 23

### PRs and issues


## Notes

### forum for numfocus projects
- cross-project forum for discussion of intersecting problems.
- one monolithic place for users to ask for help.  
- move our discourse there? 
- Hannah let them know we are in favour, theoretically.

### subfigures and dpi

- dpi could be because not being passed down correctly.

### constrained_layout at draw

- @QuLogic will consider.


### colorbar work
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/19553
- callback or weakrefs to the a list of colorbars...
- current behavior:
    - ScalerMabble.set_clim() 
        - sets values on norms, 
        - change callback: notifies listeners that it's changed (draw, caches, etc)
    - doesn't happen when you change norm, but passing in data does trigger SM.set_clim chain
    - forward propagating happens in .set_clim, can also update the vmin/vmax norm passed into SM directly
- change in PR:
    - adds change callback to norm so it doesn't need to be in set_clim
    - benefit is listner gets moved to Norm
- suggestions:
    - add tests to ensure that callback chain is correct

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/19515
- should changing the min/max on the colorbar induce a change on the norms vmin/vmax
    - if zoom on region, grab the x,y as your x/y lower limits, would autorelim the scale
    - removed the ability to do that on contour sets
        - in cbar init, set interactive on the axes depending on the mappable & the norm
            - discrete norms don't have zoom
- still same zoom controls/behavior on axes
- colorbar ticks/labels (data) stay same but colors can be moved around


### add set_XYZ kwargs to FigureBase, SubFigure, Figure 
- https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/20115
- important change is adds **kwargs to `def __init__(self, **kwargs):`
- what is the scope of set?
    - goes through every set_* in whatever artists it is being applied to
    - set documentation rewrite looks for all .set_* methods too
- sidenote: is set rather than properties b/c many attributes have multiple properties
    - ex: title has string, fontproperties, location, etc
    -
