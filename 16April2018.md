@Eric F, @Ryan M, @Thomas C, @hannah a, @Antony L 

- Documentation Summit: Who wants to come? (And where are you located?)
- PRs:
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11048
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11027
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11055
## Notes
- imshow Python refactor:
  - agg interpolation 
- 11027 - @Thomas C 
  - Add one more dial to automatic spacing based on font size
  - assuming x axis tick labels are wider than y axis - more ticks on y than x
  - wants algorithm to factor in when x is smaller - dynamic guessing of xtick size
  - adding unnecessary? complexity 
  - @Ryan M - subclass locator, make it first class citizen in library
  - @Antony L monkey patch axis api:
    - add public API to replace methods
    - tell user to subclass locator - have subclassing API
  -  set default axes for axis
  - @Eric F generalize API to accomplish same by making two new parameters:
    - x tick label size/ y tick label size - access to these properties
    - trying to estimate how large tick will be in axis dimension (based on character width and height, not fontsize)
    - Public API change to locator:
      - control multiples of x and y tick label size
      - heuristic is combining stuff from axis to locator
    - deprecate get_tick_space, replace with private method that 
      - gets length of tick in points
      - fontsize in points
      - locator can get axis object for axis names (x or y)
  - need easy way to subclass locators instead of having to subclass axis
- 11048 - @Thomas C 
  - move bar grouping out of hist into its own thing so that it can be a shared private function
  - add a plt.multibar/groupedbar to support multiple bars that can call bar underneath the hood
    - can prune some of the features of bar: no bottom, no alignment, 
    - grouping - by variable (y) or by x(category)
    - API design with no implementation first + how it’d be used by refactored hist
  - follow plot and pandas semantics with respect to broadcasting x to y: each column is a dataseries/variable
  - replace some of histograms logic with a call to multibar
  - @Eric F create a hierarchy of how the plots build on top of each other
  - bar charts x tick labels should probably be fixedlocator/fixedformatter by default
- 11055 
  - @Antony L easy to restore, unclear what it does, doesn’t think it works
  - @Ryan M conda-forge testing branch makes setup_cfg use the local freetype
  - use case: conda looks up listed packages, so you can run only the tests and install the test data, can check all the files that were installed and say “that’s my package” which is a test only package that only contains test results
  - newer versions of conda build can generate multiple packages out of one recipe
  - pitch it back to conda unless they ask about it?
- +Documentation summit 
  - Late Summer/Early Fall - 2-3 days
  - Manning people want long form narrative explaining step by step
  - thoughts
    - @Eric F - summer is better than fall (mid august)
    - @Antony L - intermediate level docs  (step function in documentation)
      - does this already exist?
      - defining what is intermediate? - @Antony L what is Python? what is matplotlib?
