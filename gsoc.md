# GSOC Admin
Matplotlib's GSOC is run under the NumFocus umbrella, and NumFocus has deadlines earlier than the google deadlines. 

GSOC admin work is mostly keeping track of google's timeline, communicating that timeline to the dev team, and ensuring that the NumFocus and google requirements and deadlines are met. 

## Info for [2023 GSOC](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/11/get-ready-for-google-summer-of-code-2023.html):
* 10-22 week
* medium at ~175 hours or large at ~350 hours
* open to students and to beginners in open source software development (must be able to legally work in whichever country they are residing in)

## tasks
### preliminary
Every year, NumFocus has to reapply for GSOC & mentoring slots & mpl has to indicate interest
- [ ] ask devs if there are any projects suited to gsoc - fairly stand alone & have good buy in are some criteria
- [ ] get on the numfocus GSOC mailing list (email help@numfocus.org if unsure how)
- [ ] sign up project with NumFocus - this is usually just telling the NumFocus GSOC admin that mpl is interested

### proposal  
- [ ] wrangle projects/mentors, seek outside collabs as needed.
- [ ] create a page describing the projects:
    * https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/wiki/GSOC-2021-ideas
    * https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/projects/12
    * https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/wiki/GSOC-2019-Ideas-Page
- [ ] publicize projects: mailing list, discourse, social media

### engaging w/ applicants phase
- [ ] make sure all mentors are registered with numfocus to have access to the gsoc dashboard: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ - this is where the applicants will submit the final version of their proposal, and later on their work, and where mentors will submit evaluations 
- [ ] encourage applicants to submit proposals (they should put matplotlib in the title because there's a 10 tag limit on gsoc's proposal interface and mpl didn't make the cut)
- [ ] provide feedback on proposals & remind applicants to switch any draft proposals to final proposals

### application review/submission phase
Google gives about a week or two to review applications & it's acceptable/common to reach out to applicants if you'd like them to do something (interview, open issue, open pull request, etc) during this time period
- [ ] tell numfocus admin how many slots you want
- [ ] tell numfocus which applicants you want to accept (based on # slots)

### evaluations
https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/evaluations
Google has two-three evaluation periods, the mentor **must** fill these out or the student will get dropped. One mentor per participant. 
- [ ] midterm
- [ ] final


### student blog posts
NumFocus also often wants the participants to submit periodic blog posts about their work. In the past, the recommendation has been roughly every two weeks, minimally:
- [ ] introduce project + biography
- [ ] midterm 
- [ ] final 

We've suggested they post these to the blog https://blog.scientific-python.org/tags/matplotlib/
