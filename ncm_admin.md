A "New contributor" meeting can be organized as an "Office hours" meeting (inviting questions and requests for support from new contributors); they can be organized as webinars, with talks or sessions on a specific aspect of contributing, such as the contribution workflow or running tests, for example; and they can also be practical working sessions, such as a walking through a full contribution task with the participants.

Currently our _New contributor meetings_ run monthly on the first Tuesday of the month, with two alternating timezones:
- 11am UTC
- 5pm UTC
These can be re-evaluated depending on attendance and demand from community members.

Some important notes:
- Use these meetings as an opportunity to set expectations for newcomers - about how long it takes for a contribution to be reviewed, how new features are discussed in the project or the areas that would best be served by contributors with less experience in the project.
- Have a [meeting notes document](https://hackmd.io/@matplotlib/ByJONqetn), open to all. This document will contain the agenda for the meeting, notes on what was decided/discussed, and if appropriate a record of who attended (with their internet handle attached if they are comfortable sharing!). **Make sure you ask for consent before noting personal information in the notes, since they are public.** This is important so that we can track folks who come to the meeting on GitHub later.
- Our new contributor meeting has a post-meeting survey that pops up when folks leave. It is a very short 3 question survey to gauge how useful and welcoming the meeting was. If you can, mention this before ending the meeting.

## During the meeting
- [ ] Mention meeting notes document, make sure all folks have access to it
- [ ] Optional: _If you want to record_ be sure to ask for consent, and offer people to mute and turn off their video.

**Note:** Many people benefit from these meetings, but for many different reasons can't turn on their camera or speak aloud during the meeting. This may be due to internet issues, hardware or personal situations including their work environment or accessibility requirements. Ideally, they need a way to participate via text, either through the meeting chat or the meeting notes document.
